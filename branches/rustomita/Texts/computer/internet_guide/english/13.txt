2.3  PINE -- AN EVEN BETTER WAY

Pine is based on elm but includes a number of improvements that make it 
an ideal mail system for beginners.   Like elm, pine starts you with a 
menu.  It also has an "address book" feature that is handy for people 
with long or complex e-mail addresses. Hitting A at the main menu puts 
you in the address book, where you can type in the person's first name 
(or nickname) followed by her address. Then, when you want to send that 
person a message, you only have to type in her first name or nickname, 
and Pine automatically inserts her actual address. The address book 
also lets you set up a mailing list.  This feature allows you to send the 
same message to a number of people at once. 

What really sets Pine apart is its built-in text editor, which looks and 
feels a lot more like word-processing programs available for MS-DOS and 
Macintosh users.  Not only does it have word wrap (a revolutionary 
concept if ever there was one), it also has a spell-checker and a search 
command. Best of all, all of the commands you need are listed in a twoline mini-menu at the bottom of each screen.  The commands look like 
this: 
 
     ^W Where is 
 
The little caret is a synonym for the key marked "control" on your 
keyboard.  To find where a particular word is in your document, hit 
control-w (depress your control key, then hit w) you'd hit your control 
key and your W key at the same time, which would bring up a prompt asking 
you for the word to look for.  Some of Pine's commands are a tad peculiar 
(control-V for "page down" for example), which comes from being based on 
a variant of the emacs text processor (which is utterly peculiar).  But 
again, all of the commands you need are listed on that two-line minimenu, so it shouldn't take you more than a couple of seconds to find the 
right one.  To use Pine, type 
 
     pine 
 
at the command line and hit enter.
