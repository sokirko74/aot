3.5  rn COMMANDS
 
 
Different commands are available to you in rn depending on whether you 
are already in a newsgroup or reading a specific article. At any point, 
typing a lowercase h will bring up a list of available commands and some 
terse instructions for using them. Here are some of them: 
 
After you've just called up rn, or within a newsgroup:
 
c             Marks every article in a newsgroup as read (or "caught up")
              so that you don't have to see them again. The system will ask 
              you if you are sure. Can be done either when asked if you
              want to read a particular newsgroup or once in the newsgroup.
 
g             Goes to a newsgroup, in this form: 
     
                        g news.group 
      
              Use this both for going to groups to which you're already 
              subscribed and subscribing to new groups. 
 
h             Provides a list of available commands with terse 
              instructions.
 
l             Gives a list of all available newsgroups.
 
p             Goes to the first previous subscribed newsgroup with un-read 
              articles. 
 
q             Quits, or exits, rn if you have not yet gone into a newsgroup. 
              If you are in a newsgroup, it quits that one and brings you to 
              the next subscribed newsgroup. 
 
Only within a newsgroup:
 
=             Gives a list of all available articles in the newsgroup.
 
 
m             Marks a specific article or series of articles as "un-read" 
              again so that you can come back to them later. Typing
 
                        1700m
 
              and hitting enter would mark just that article as un-read. 
              Typing 
 
                        1700-1800m
 
              and hitting enter would mark all of those articles as unread.
 
space         Brings up the next page of article listings.  If already on
              the last page, displays the first article in the newsgroup.
 
u             Un-subscribe from the newsgroup. 
 
/text/        Searches through the newsgroup for articles with a specific
              word or phrase in the "subject:" line, from the current 
              article to the end of the newsgroup. For example, 
 
                        /EFF/
 
              would bring you to the first article with "EFF" in the 
              "subject:" line.
 
?text?        The same as /text/ except it searches in reverse order from 
              the current article.
 
Only within a specific article:
 
e             Some newsgroups consist of articles that are binary files, 
              typically programs or graphics images.  Hitting e will convert 
              the ASCII characters within such an article into a file you
              can then download and use or view (assuming you have the proper
              computer and software).  Many times, such files will be split
              into several articles; just keep calling up the articles and
              hitting e until done.  You'll find the resulting file in your
              News subdirectory.

C             If you post an article and then decide it was a mistake, call 
              it up on your host system and hit this.  The message will soon 
              begin disappearing on systems around the world. 
 
F             Post a public response in the newsgroup to the current 
              article.  Includes a copy of her posting, which you can then 
              edit down using your host system's text editor. 
 
f             The same as above except it does not include a copy of the 
              original message in yours.
 
m             Marks the current article as "un-read" so that you can come 
              back to it later.  You do not have to type the article 
              number.       
 
Control-N     Brings up the first response to the article. If there is no 
              follow-up article, this returns you to the first unread article 
              in the newsgroup). 
 
Control-P     Goes to the message to which the current article is a reply.
 
n             Goes to the next unread article in the newsgroup. 
 
N             Takes you to the next article in the newsgroup even if you've 
              already read it.
 
q             Quits, or exits, the current article. Leaves you in the current 
              newsgroup.
 
R             Reply, via e-mail only, to the author of the current article. 
              Includes a copy of his message in yours.
 
r             The same as above, except it does not include a copy of his 
              article.
 
s file        Copies the current article to a file in your News directory, 
              where "file" is the name of the file you want to save it to. 
              You'll be asked if you want to use "mailbox" format when 
              saving. If you answer by hitting your N key, most of the 
              header will not be saved. 

s|mail user   Mails a copy of the article to somebody. For "user" substitute
              an e-mail address. Does not let you add comments to the 
              message first, however.
 
space         Hitting the space bar shows the next page of the article, or, if 
              at the end, goes to the next un-read article.
