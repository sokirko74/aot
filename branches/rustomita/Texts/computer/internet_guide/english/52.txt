10.7  THE ALL KNOWING ORACLE


One other thing you can do through e-mail is consult with the Usenet 
Oracle.  You can ask the Oracle anything at all and get back an answer 
(whether you'll like the answer is another question). 

First, you'll want to get instructions on how to address the Oracle (he, 
or she, or it, is very particular about such things and likes being 
addressed in august, solemn and particularly sycophantic tones).  Start 
an e-mail message to 
 
     oracle@iuvax.cs.indiana.edu 
 
In the "subject:" line, type 
 
     help 
  
and hit enter.  You don't actually have to say anything in the message 
itself -- at least not yet.  Hit control-D to send off your request 
for help.  Within a few hours, the Oracle will mail you back detailed 
instructions.  It's a fairly long file, so before you start reading 
it, turn on your communications software's logging function, to save 
it to your computer (or save the message to a file on your host system's 
home directory and then download the file).  After you've digested it, 
you can compose your question to the Oracle.  Mail it to the above 
address, only this time with a subject line that describes your 
question.  Expect an answer within a couple of days. And don't be 
surprised if you also find a question in your mailbox -- the Oracle 
extracts payment by making seekers of knowledge answer questions as 
well!
