                 Like most UNIX systems, Linux provides a number of software 
packages for using electronic mail. E-mail on your system can either be local 
(that is, you only mail other users on your system), or networked (that is, you 
mail, using either TCP/IP or UUCP, users on other machines on a network). E-mail 
software usually consists of two parts: a mailer and a transport. The mailer is 
the user-level software which is used to actually compose and read e-mail 
messages. Popular mailers include elm and mailx. The transport is the low-level 
software which actually takes care of delivering the mail, either locally or 
remotely. The user never sees the transport software; they only interact with 
the mailer. However, as the system administrator, it is important to understand 
the concepts behind the transport software and how to configure it. 

    The most popular transport software for Linux is Smail. This software is 
easy to configure, and is able to send both local and remote TCP/IP and UUCP e-
mail. The more powerful sendmail transport is used on most UNIX systems, 
however, because of its complicated setup mechanism, many Linux systems don't 
use it. 

The Linux Mail HOWTO gives more information on the available mail software for 
Linux and how to configure it on your system. If you plan to send mail remotely, 
you'll need to understand either TCP/IP or UUCP, depending on how your machine 
is networked (see Sections 5.3 and 5.4). The UUCP and TCP/IP documents listed in 
Appendix A should be of help there. 

Most of the Linux mail software can be retrieved via anonymous FTP from 
sunsite.unc.edu in the directory /pub/Linux/system/Mail.
