The Objectives, Tasks and Instruments of the Exchange Rate Policy
The Bank of Russia implements its foreign exchange policy in the general context 
of the monetary policy pursued by the Government and Central Bank of the Russian 
Federation. The major objectives of the Bank of Russia foreign exchange policy 
are to ensure stability of the national currency and create conditions for the 
dynamic development of Russia's foreign exchange market.
In order to create conditions in the foreign exchange market corresponding to 
the objectives of the exchange rate policy and to manage (to even out) the 
rouble exchange rate, the Bank of Russia makes use of the following main 
instruments:
- foreign exchange interventions;
- deposit operations to regulate the level of rouble liquidity in the interbank 
market;
- shifting interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations in the money market.
The effect of using the market instruments of the exchange rate policy depends 
on the state of the monetary sphere as a whole and on the general economic 
situation.
When tendencies emerge in the domestic foreign exchange market, posing a threat 
of long-term destabiliaztion of the exchange rate, the Bank of Russia may also 
take additional measures, such as:
- changing the procedure for and the required rate of exporters' foreign 
exchange earnings surrendering;
- changing the reserve requirements and other economic and prudential standards 
of credit organizations;
- modifying the procedure for conducting foreign exchange trading on the 
authorized currency exchanges and foreign exchange transaction rules.
The Bank of Russia continuously improves the system of control over the main 
sectors of the foreign exchange market, especially over transactions at the 
authorized currency exchanges, securing quick and effective use of the foreign 
exchange policy instruments.
Foreign Exchange Policy in 1998 and the Bank of Russia Policy Response to the 
Financial Crisis
The main feature of the exchange rate policy in the first half of 1998 was the 
setting of middle-term targets for the rouble exchange rate dynamics (the so-
called "currency band"). The quantitative parameters of the exchange rate 
policy-the range of possible fluctuations of the exchange rate of the rouble 
from 5.25 roubles to 7.15 roubles to the US dollar-were established, taking into 
consideration the rouble exchange rate situation in the domestic foreign 
exchange market during the preceding period. The decisive factors were a 
significant surplus in Russia's balance of trade and large foreign portfolio 
investments in Russia. In some periods the capital inflow put substantial upward 
pressure on the rouble rate and enabled the Bank of Russia to significantly 
increase its foreign exchange reserves.
The crisis that hit more or less all sectors of the Russian financial market had 
been gradually developing. It is a common knowledge that the most significant 
achievement of the financial stabilization policy in Russia was the suppression 
of inflation (in 1997 consumer prices rose only by 11%). However, as budget 
expenditures continued to exceed revenues, the use by the Government of non-
inflationary sources of financing the budget deficit led to significant growth 
in government debt. The crisis that broke out in East Asian financial markets 
compelled many foreign investors to review their investment strategy with regard 
to the transitional economies and emerging markets. As a result, the inflow of 
foreign investment to the Russian government debt market dwindled, while the 
government debt-servicing expenditures grew considerably. Decrease in the world 
prices of oil and some other key Russian exports led to the reduction of 
Russia's balance of trade surplus and eventually in the first half of 1998 the 
current account of the balance of payments slipped into negative ground. 
One of the main manifestations of the crisis was recurrent instability in the 
Russian financial markets, which first occurred in the autumn of 1997 and led to 
growth in the demand for foreign exchange and increased pressure on the rouble 
exchange rate. There appeared expectations of a sharp fall in the rouble rate in 
the financial markets. Selling roubles, participants in the Russian financial 
markets tried to minimize the possible negative consequences of the deepening 
financial crisis, which, as world experience shows, result, above all, in a 
sharp devaluation of the domestic currency. Worried by the developments, foreign 
investors tried to get rid of investments in Russian financial instruments.
In January-July 1998 the Bank of Russia using instruments of foreign exchange 
and monetary policy managed to ensure stability of the exchange rate of the 
rouble, but the exchange rate stability was maintained at the price of foreign 
exchange reserve depletion. Aid received by Russia in July from international 
financial institutions provided ground for hopes that the financial crisis would 
be overcome without substantial damage to the real sector of the economy. 
However, even with considerable loans it appeared impossible to contain the 
development of the negative trends and the crisis exacerbated. Demand for 
foreign exchange had been growing since May 1998 and the Bank of Russia had to 
spend considerable foreign exchange resources to maintain the exchange rate at 
the level of 6.10-6.30 roubles to the dollar. In a bid to avoid the decline of 
the currency reserves below the critical point, the Bank of Russia on August 17 
had to abandon the practice of announcing daily buy and sell rates of the dollar 
in the interbank foreign exchange market and review mid-term targets of the 
rouble exchange rate dynamics. New limits were set on the rouble rate 
fluctuations at 6.0 roubles to 9.5 roubles to the dollar, but keeping the 
ruble/dollar rate within this band was conditioned by successful implementation 
of anti-crisis measures.
Although it no longer announced daily buy and sell rates of the dollar, the Bank 
of Russia in the second half of August continued to conduct foreign exchange 
interventions to check growth in the dollar rate. However, despite the Bank of 
Russia efforts, the dollar rose quickly. On September 1 the official rate rose 
to 9.3301 roubles to the dollar, an increase of almost 50% on the August 15 rate 
of 6.2900 roubles to the dollar. That situation forced the Bank of Russia to 
give up large foreign exchange interventions at the end of August and let the 
market locate the exchange rate of the rouble at which demand and supply of 
foreign exchange would be balanced, confining Bank of Russia's operations to the 
task of evening out the exchange rate dynamics. Early in September the Bank of 
Russia announced the switch to a floating exchange rate regime.
The initial adjustment of the market to the new conditions was complicated with 
sharp fluctuations of the exchange rate, which were compounded by relatively low 
aggregate turnover of operations in the foreign exchange market. The rouble 
exchange rate dynamics was determined not so much by the current state of the 
Russian economy, as by the expectations of further deterioration of the 
situation, making forecasting the exchange rate on the basis of fundamental 
macroeconomic indicators practically impossible. However, the exchange rate 
fluctuations in September showed the approximate limits of the band within which 
a balanced rouble rate may be maintained and its relative stabilization was 
possible. In the last 10 days of September the exchange rate of the rouble 
volatility diminished significantly. Overall, in 1998 the official exchange rate 
of the US dollar to the Russian rouble rose from 5.96 to 20.65 rubles to the 
dollar, or 3.46 times.
To restore the domestic foreign exchange market, ensure the return of export 
earnings to Russia and create conditions for replenishment of the official 
foreign exchange reserves, the Bank of Russia in September began to implement a 
series of measures to tighten foreign exchange regulation and foreign exchange 
control. Since September 16 exporters are required to sell their export earnings 
on currency exchanges only and since October 1 export earnings are sold only at 
the special trading sessions of interbank currency exchanges. On December 31 the 
proportion of foreign exchange earnings which exporters are required to sell was 
raised to 75% and the periods during which export earnings must be repatriated 
and sold were shortened. From January 1, 1999, the limits on the open foreign 
currency position of banks were lowered. 
Domestic Foreign Exchange Market
In the first half of 1998 the interbank foreign exchange spot market functioned 
without irregularities, and its volume of transactions was almost twice that of 
the first half of 1997. The crisis in the Russian financial market in August 
1998 became the main factor that had significant impact on the structure of the 
foreign exchange market. Prior to the crisis most foreign exchange operations 
were conducted in the interbank market, with average monthly volume on both spot 
and forward (delivery and settlement) rouble/dollar transactions in that period 
exceeding $140 billion. The average monthly volume of transactions on the 
authorized currency exchanges during that period made up about 1.5% of the 
interbank market volume, or $2.2 billion. After August 17 operations on the 
interbank foreign exchange market were suspended almost completely. The bulk of 
transactions moved to the authorized currency exchanges (Moscow Interbank 
Currency Exchange, or MICEX, and seven regional currency exchanges), which 
guaranteed settlements on deals. On August 26 US dollar trading with rate fixing 
was suspended on MICEX due to a considerable imbalance between the demand for 
foreign exchange and its supply, and on August 28 trading with rate fixing was 
suspended for the same reason on all authorized regional currency exchanges. 
Electronic lot trading systems of the currency exchanges assumed the role of the 
main mechanism of conducting conversion operations. The average monthly volume 
of transactions on the authorized currency exchanges in the post-crisis period 
was about $3.2 billion.
The foreign exchange forward market registered a sharp fall in transaction 
volumes and shortening of terms since December 1997 due to the general worsening 
of the situation in the domestic financial markets and a vast amount of 
obligations between banks, accumulated in the preceding period. The average 
daily turnover of forward transactions in 1998 was almost three times lower than 
in 1997. Non-deliverable forward contracts continued to make up the lion's share 
of transactions.
Foreign Exchange Policy in 1999
The floating exchange rate regime will be retained this year. An indispensable 
condition for stability of the rouble exchange rate in 1999 is balanced monetary 
policy, ensuring compliance with the targets set for money supply growth. The 
principal objective of the exchange rate policy pursued by the Bank of Russia in 
1999 is to ensure stability and predictability of the rouble exchange rate 
dynamics and prevent abrupt fluctuations of the rouble rate. To attain this 
objective market instruments of the exchange rate and monetary policy are used. 
The Bank of Russia may also introduce changes and modifications of the foreign 
exchange regulations and foreign exchange controls as well as implement all the 
necessary measures to ensure that economic agents comply with the Russian 
legislation regulating foreign exchange operations.
The Bank of Russia sees one of its chief tasks in 1999 in restoring public and 
corporate confidence in the rouble, which was considerably undermined by its 
abrupt devaluation. A major task ensuring simultaneously the achievement of 
other targets and purposes of the foreign exchange policy is that of maintaining 
the official foreign exchange reserves at the level ensuring stability of the 
Russian monetary and financial system. Practically the only way of replenishing 
foreign exchange reserves is the Bank of Russia's purchases of the foreign 
exchange sold by exporters in the domestic foreign exchange market in accordance 
with the regulations requiring exporters to sell a part of their export 
earnings.
The rouble exchange rate in 1999 will be set as a rate balancing the demand for 
and supply of Russian roubles in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Russia 
will continue with the practice of setting the official exchange rate of the 
rouble against foreign currencies on the basis of the rouble market rate against 
these currencies and foreign currencies' cross-rates in the foreign exchange 
markets. The Bank of Russia will seek to maintain a unified exchange rate of the 
rouble in all sectors of the domestic foreign exchange market. It will manage 
rouble rate mainly by market instruments, such as interventions, shifts in 
interest rates and deposit operations. The Bank of Russia will resort to 
administrative action only if there arises the threat of a crisis in the foreign 
exchange market, which may destabilize Russia's entire monetary and financial 
system. 
From mid-August to the end of December 1998 the rouble/dollar real exchange rate 
index declined by more than 45% and there is reason to believe that this level 
of the real exchange rate of the rouble, which is determined by the correlation 
of the inflation rate and the pace of change in the exchange rate, will persist 
in the first half of 1999. A significant surplus in the current account of 
Russia's balance of payments, accumulated in the fourth quarter of 1998 and 
forecasted for 1999, should positively influence the exchange rate dynamics. 
The effectiveness of the exchange rate policy will depend on the state of the 
domestic foreign exchange market in 1999. Foreign exchange operations have 
dropped in volume dramatically as the solvency of banks - the main participants 
in the foreign exchange market - have been decreasing. As a result of the plunge 
of the exchange rate of the rouble after the revision of the fundamental 
principles of the exchange rate policy in August 1998 many Russian banks which 
had assumed obligations to deliver foreign exchange under forward contracts 
found themselves unable to meet their commitments. Volumes in the interbank 
foreign exchange market may return to pre-crisis levels only if confidence in 
the banking sector is restored. As the experience of the previous years shows, 
this process may take a long time and its outcome will depend on the recovery of 
the country's banking system as a whole. As the rouble exchange rate dynamics 
becomes more predictable and the financial markets recover, the necessary 
conditions will emerge for the development of all sectors of the domestic 
foreign exchange market, including the forward and derivatives markets. 
The main mechanism of conducting foreign exchange transactions in the near 
future will be the lot trading systems of the authorized currency exchanges. 
This, in addition to the economic factors described above, will be a result of 
the regulation requiring exporters to sell 75% of their export earnings at the 
special trading sessions on the currency exchanges. The Bank of Russia actively 
participates in drafting and refining rules to conduct currency trading on 
exchanges, taking into account the interests of different groups of foreign 
exchange market participants. The principal objectives of the Bank of Russia are 
to ensure that trading is conducted without interruptions and prevent abrupt 
fluctuations of the exchange rate of the rouble.

The Bank of Russia believes that in 1999 it must ensure that GDP dynamics 
corresponds to the money supply (M2) in order to prevent an inflationary 
overheating of the economy. The intermediate objective of the Bank of Russia's 
monetary policy in 1999 is to maintain M2 growth rates at within the bands of 
18-26%.
Owing to the underdevelopment of financial markets, which have changed for the 
worse under the impact of the financial crisis, it is now impossible to use 
interest rate indicators as intermediate targets of the monetary policy. The 
state of the balance of payments in 1998-1999 and the present level of 
international reserves do not permit the use of the exchange rate, that is 
fixing it in one way or another, for these purposes. 
To readjust in time and effectively its monetary policy, in 1999 the Bank of 
Russia uses, in addition to its intermediate target, a wide range of indicators, 
such as nominal and real interest rates, nominal and real exchange rate 
dynamics, the dynamics of the world prices of Russian exports and imports, and 
yield curves of various financial instruments. The dollarisation of the Russian 
economy, which especially increased in 1998, makes it particularly important to 
use (M2X) broad money as indicator.
One of the monetary policy priorities in 1999 is to ensure economically sound 
dynamics of the exchange rate of the ruble. A floating exchange rate regime is 
in place now, but the Bank of Russia's presence in the foreign exchange market 
is strictly limited and aims to cushion sharp rate fluctuations and protect the 
ruble from possible massive speculative attacks. The main condition of stability 
of the ruble rate dynamics is a balanced monetary policy ensuring compliance 
with the established money supply growth targets.
The exchange rate policy of the Bank of Russia is designed to regulate interest 
rates on its own operations in order to maintain the required level of liquidity 
of the banking system.
The chief means of providing additional liquidity to the banking system in 1999 
is refinancing of commercial banks by granting them collateralised credits 
(intraday and overnight credits) and stabilisation credits for a term of up to 1 
year within the limits of the monetary policy targets. As the situation in the 
banking sector returns to normal, the Bank of Russia will consistently reduce 
the proportion of stabilisation credits in the total refinancing volume, 
simultaneously expanding and improving the practice of extending collateralised 
credits and upgrading the instruments to fine-tune liquidity of the banking 
system.
Regarding deposit operations as a major means of regulating liquidity, the Bank 
of Russia on February 24 extended the term of deposit transactions with resident 
banks to 30 days.
The Bank of Russia is currently working on a set of measures to use the 
operations to rediscount promissory notes and other obligations issued by 
enterprises in the real economy.
