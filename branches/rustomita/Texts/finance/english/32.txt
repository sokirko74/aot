
	    BANK OF RUSSIA COMMEMORATIVE COINS

        Within the framework of its emission policy, the
        Bank of Russia issues commemorative coins made of
        precious and non-precious metals and distributes
        them in the domestic and foreign numismatic markets.
        It has been engaged in this activity since its
        inception in 1992 (previously, from 1965 to 1991,
        commemorative coins were issued by the State Bank of
        the USSR).

        Between 1988 and 1996 the Bank of Russia issued more
        than 30 series of commemorative coins made of gold,
        silver, platinum and palladium alloys (a total of
        nearly 4 million coins). In recent years, the Bank
        of Russia has attached priority to long-term coin
        programmes such as "The Millennium of Russia,”
        "Russian Ballet," "The Red Book of Russia,"
        "Russia's Architectural Monuments," “The Great
        Russians" and "Save the World" as well as series
        devoted to major geographical discoveries.

        In 1995 the Bank of Russia issued a number of
        special commemorative coin series devoted to the
        50th anniversary of victory in Great Patriotic War
        and the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, and
        in 1996 it issued a series commemorating the 300th
        anniversary of the Russian navy. In 1997 the Bank of
        Russia plans to issue a special coin series to
        commemorate Moscow's 850th anniversary.

        In 1996 the Bank of Russia issued silver and gold
        coins intended for operations in the investment
        market for sale in the domestic market for the first
        time. These are the 3-rouble Sobol coin of 1995
        issue, containing 31.1 grams of fine silver, and the
        gold chervonets of 1979-1981 mintage, containing
        7.74 grams of fine gold.

        The Bank of Russia coins are made by the Moscow and
        St. Petersburg mints. They are noted for their high
        artistic standards and impeccable quality of
        manufacture and they sell well in Russia and other
        countries.

        The Bank of Russia commemorative and investment
        coins are distributed by more than 20 banks, such as
        the commercial bank Rossiisky Kredit, the Savings
        Bank, Gazprombank, Promradtekhbank, Olimpiisky,
        Inkombank and Menatep.
