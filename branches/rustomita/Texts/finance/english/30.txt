        The security characteristics of all notes issued in
        1995 were standardised:

        1. There is a security thread that can be seen by
        putting a note to the light.

        2. There are two watermarks on the coupon margins of
        the notes. The watermark on the narrow margin is the
        digital denomination of the note and the watermark
        on the wide margin shows a fragment of the main
        front-side image.

        3. The inscription BILET BANKA ROSSII in the upper
        right hand corner of the face of the note and the
        mark for people with poor eyesight in the lower left
        hand corner are made with a thickened layer of ink.

        4. When viewed at an acute angle, the note shows the
        letters "PP" on the lower fragment of the ornamental
        ribbon on the front side.

        5. On the back of the note over its denomination the
        microprinted line BANK ROSSII is repeated many
        times. In addition, the 1,000, 50,000 and 100,000
        rouble notes have microprinted digital denominations
        repeated many times in the upper part of the reverse
        side.

        The Bank of Russia emblem in the left upper corner
        of the face of the 500,000-rouble note is printed
        with optically changeable ink: viewed at different
        angles the emblem changes colour from yellow-green
        to orange-red.

        The Bank of Russia notes of 1993 issue remain in
        circulation along with the new notes as legal tender
        of the Russian Federation.
