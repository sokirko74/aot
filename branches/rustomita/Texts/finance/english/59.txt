        Current Trends

        The business activity index, calculated by the Bank
        of Russia, shows that in April 1998 the process of
        stabilisation continued.

        The industrial recovery, which was registered
        throughout 1997, also continued in April 1998 and
        became particularly manifest in some
        machine-building sectors and the light industry.

        The decline in investment activity slowed down in
        January-April 1998.

        During the first four months of this year the
        decline of business activity continued to slow in
        livestock farming and it worsened in transport.

        The situation on the Russian money market in May
        hinged closely upon nonresidents’ conduct on the
        government and corporate securities markets.
        Volatility was sparked off by foreign investor
        concerns over a new wave of the South East Asian
        financial market crisis, which led to a repeat of
        the developments of late 1997 when foreign
        participants started selling vast amounts of Russian
        securities and transfer money to the foreign
        exchange market. As a result, GKO-OFZ yields and
        interbank credit rates soared.

        Over the four months of this year the consumer price
        index rose by 3.5% and the industrial producer price
        index went up by 1.3% (6.4% and 5.0% respectively
        during the same period of last year).

        Household real disposable cash incomes in
        January-April 1998 were at the level of 92.6% of the
        corresponding period of last year. In January-April
        1997 they were 103.9% of the same period of 1996.
        The proportion of consumer expenditures in the
        structure of household cash income use, which was
        high at the beginning of the year, remained so in
        April. In January-April 1998 it was 75.6%. The share
        of savings shrank as a result.

        The number of the officially registered unemployed
        in April continued to decrease.

        In January-March 1998 foreign trade volumes
        plummeted owing to a sharp decline in exports, which
        resulted from a significant drop in prices on the
        world energy market and a fall in the prices of
        non-energy products. Exports fell by 14.4%; the
        physical volume index, calculated for commodities
        accounting for nearly 75% of exports, was 0.99 and
        the price index was 0.81.

        The average ruble/dollar rate in May decreased by
        3.4% compared with December 1997. In May 1998 the
        real rate of the ruble against the US dollar fell by
        0.1%.
