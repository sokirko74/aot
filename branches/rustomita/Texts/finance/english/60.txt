          Since 1992 the monetary policy pursued by the Bank
          of Russia has aimed at bringing about financial
          stabilisation, especially lowering the inflation
          rate, bolstering the rouble's exchange rate and
          ensuring stability of the country's balance of
          payments, and creating conditions conducive to
          favourable structural changes in the economy.

          The fundamental principle guiding the monetary and
          credit regulation policy implemented by the Bank
          of Russia is imposing quantitative restrictions on
          money supply growth. However, since 1996 monetary
          policy priorities have been gradually shifting
          towards growth in real money supply in the
          economy, accompanied by further reduction of
          average monthly inflation rates. In 1997 the M2
          grew by 17.4% in real terms against 10% in 1996.
          This year the M2 is expected to grow by 22-30%,
          while inflation will not rise by more than 10% and
          GDP is to expand by 2%.

          One of the signs of sustained saturation of the
          economy with money was the slowing of the velocity
          of money circulation, which began in 1996. The
          average velocity of M2 slowed from 8.7 in 1996 to
          7.9 in 1997. In 1998 the main preconditions for a
          further slowdown in money velocity are expected to
          remain.

          The decline in the general level of interest
          rates, which began in 1996, continued throughout
          1997 and at the beginning of 1998 (the raising of
          the refinancing rate in November 1997 and February
          1998 was a short-term anti-crisis measure).

          The exchange-rate policy pursued by the Bank of
          Russia since mid-1995, which aims to stabilise the
          exchange rate of the rouble and make it more
          predictable, played a significant role in
          normalising the macroeconomic situation in Russia.
          The practice of setting minimum and maximum limits
          on rouble exchange-rate fluctuations ensured
          predictability of the exchange-rate dynamics in
          1995-1997. Progress made in financial
          stabilisation made it possible for the first time
          to set the limits of the rouble band for the whole
          of 1997.

          Taking into consideration the increased
          integration of Russia with the world's financial
          markets and remaining committed to the principle
          of predictability and continuity of policy, the
          Bank of Russia has decided to switch from
          short-term limits on rouble exchange-rate
          fluctuations to targeting the medium-term
          exchange-rate dynamics. Thus, the central
          rouble/dollar rate was set for 1998-2000 at 6.2
          roubles for a dollar with possible deviations of
          15% in both directions. In 1998 the Bank of Russia
          will seek to preserve the average exchange rate at
          6.1 roubles per dollar.

          To protect the rouble and ensure its stability,
          make savings in national currency more attractive
          and discourage placing savinigs into hard currency
          buying the Bank of Russia is implementing the
          policy of further evening out required reserve
          ratios for both rouble and foreign-currency
          borrowings by lowering ratios for borrowings in
          roubles and raising them for borrowings in foreign
          currency. The Bank of Russia also intends to
          continue lowering the general level of reserve
          requirements as demand for money by economic
          agents grows.
