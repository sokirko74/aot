  RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE NATIONAL BANKING COUNCIL UNDER THE BANK OF RUSSIA

     On the Role of Banks in the Development of the Securities Market

1. To approach the President of the Russian Federation, the Government of
the Russian Federation and the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the
Russian Federation with a request to consolidate the right of credit
organisations to conduct professional activities in the securities market
on the basis of banking licence, introducing, if necessary, the
corresponding amendments to legislation or other regulatory enactments.

2. To approve the Bank of Russia’s position providing for the possibility
of voluntary specialisation of credit organisations in investment
activities. To recommend that the Bank of Russia accelerate the elaboration
of a normative base for regulating investment activities.

3. To support the idea of implementing a project to attract medium and
long-term financial resources to the production sphere by encouraging
enterprises to issue corporate debt instruments and organising their
circulation in the organised securities market. To recommend credit
organisations to step up their work with enterprises in this sphere,
especially in providing consulting services to them on the issue of bonds
and granting bank guarantees on these liabilities.
