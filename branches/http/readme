==============  Prerequisites    ========================
0.   Install cmake (at least 3.5) from https://cmake.org/download/

1.  g++ 8.0 or higher or 

2. You need flex and bison to build projects after Morphology (Synan and Seman)
    For windows I used flex and bison from https://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison/?source=typ_redirect

3. To build lemmatizer_python(switched off by default) you need swig and python-dev,
    for windows I used 
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/files/swigwin/swigwin-3.0.12/swigwin-3.0.12.zip/download
    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/
