<h1>Synan Documentation</h1>
<p>
This is a documentation to COM-Interface for Shallow Syntax Module, which was developed by Dmitry Pankratov, Lev Gershenzon, Igor Nozhov, and Alexey Sokirko in Dialing Project. The main purpose of the module is to build clause structure of each input sentence and to build simple NP groups inside clauses. Clauses and groups can be nested, that's why we use a special term (a "syntax unit" or simply a "unit"), which is a generalization of the notions of clauses and words. So a subclause as well as a simple word is a unit inside the superclause. Each clause contains a set of morphological variants, where a morphological variant is a vector of syntax units. For each morphological variant we build a set of syntax groups. The main properties of a syntax group and a clause are the same:<br>
<ul>
<li>the starting word, <br>
</li><li>the end word, <br>
</li><li>the main word <br>
</li><li>type (name). <br>
 Using a clause and group hierarchy we can build a dependency forest, where relations go from the main words of clauses or groups to the main words of the immediate subconstituents. Generally, the dependency forest can be considered as an alternative way to access syntax structure. </li></ul>
