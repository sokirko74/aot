Leanne Phillips periodically posts a list of frequently asked questions 
(and answers) about use of the rn killfile function in the 
news.newusers.questions and news.answers newsgroups on Usenet.  Bill 
Wohler posts a guide to using the nn newsreader in the news.answers and 
news.software newsgroups.  Look in the news.announce.newusers and 
news.groups newsgroups on Usenet for "A Guide to Social Newsgroups and 
Mailing Lists,'' which gives brief summaries of the various soc. 
newsgroups. 

"Managing UUCP and Usenet,' by Tim O'Reilly and Grace Todino (O'Reilly & 
Associates, 1992) is a good guide for setting up your own Usenet system.
