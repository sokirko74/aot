12.4  IRC IN TIMES OF CRISIS


IRC has become a new medium for staying on top of really big breaking 
news.  In 1993, when Russian lawmakers barricaded themselves inside the 
parliament building, some enterprising Muscovites and a couple of 
Americans set up a "news channel" on IRC to relay first-person accounts 
direct from Moscow. The channel was set up to provide a continuous loop 
of information, much like all-news radio stations that cycle through the 
day's news every 20 minutes.  In 1994, Los Angeles residents set up a 
similar channel to relay information related to the Northridge 
earthquake.  In both cases, logs of the channels were archived somewhere 
on the Net, for those unable to "tune in" live. 

How would you find such channels in the future?  Use the /list command to 
scroll through the available channels.  If one has been set up to discuss 
a particular breaking event, chances are you'll see a brief description 
next to the channel name that will tell you that's the place to tune. 


12.5  MUDs
 
 
Multiple-User Dimensions or Dungeons (MUDs) take IRC into the realm of 
fantasy.  MUDs are live, role-playing games in which you enter assume a 
new identity and enter an alternate reality through your keyboard.  As 
you explore this other world, through a series of simple commands (such 
as "look," "go" and "take"), you'll run across other users, who may 
engage you in a friendly discussion, enlist your aid in some quest or try 
to kill you for no apparent reason. 

Each MUD has its own personality and creator (or God) who was willing to 
put in the long hours required to establish the particular MUD's rules, 
laws of nature and information databases.  Some MUDs stress the social 
aspects of online communications -- users frequently gather online to 
chat and join together to build new structures or even entire realms.  
Others are closer to "Dungeons and Dragons" and are filled with 
sorcerers, dragons and evil people out to keep you from completing your 
quest -- through murder if necessary. 

Many MUDs (there are also related games known as MUCKs and MUSEs) require 
you to apply in advance, through e-mail, for a character name and 
password.  One that lets you look around first, though, is HoloMuck at 
McGill University in Montreal.  The premise of this game is that you 
arrive in the middle of Tanstaafl, a city on the planet Holo.  You have 
to find a place to live (else you get thrown into the homeless shelter) 
and then you can begin exploring.  Magic is allowed on this world, but 
only outside the city limits.  Get bored with the city and you can roam 
the rest of the world or even take a trip into orbit (of course, all this 
takes money; you can either wait for your weekly salary or take a trip to 
the city casino).  Once you become familiar with the city and get your 
own character, you can even begin erecting your own building (or subway 
line, or almost anything else).

12.8  FYI
 
You can find discussions about IRC in the alt.irc newsgroup. 

"A Discussion on Computer Network Conferencing," by Darren Reed (May, 
1992), provides a theoretical background on why conferencing systems such 
as IRC are a Good Thing.  It's available through ftp at nic.ddn.mil in 
the rfc directory as rfc1324.txt. 

Every Friday, Scott Goehring posts a new list of  MUDs and related games 
and their telnet addresses in the newsgroup rec.games.mud.announce. There 
are several other mud newsgroups related to specific types of MUDs, 
including rec.games.mud.social, rec.games.mud.adventure, 
rec.games.mud.tiny, rec.games.mud.diku and rec.games.mud.lp. 

For a good overview of the impact on the Internet of the Morris Worm, 
read "Virus Highlights Need for Improved Internet Management," by the 
U.S. General Accounting Office (June, 1989).  You can get a copy via ftp 
from cert.sei.cmu.edu in the pub/virus-l/docs directory.  It's listed as 
gao_rpt. 

Clifford Stoll describes how the Internet works and how he tracked a 
group of KGB-paid German hackers through it, in "The Cuckoo's Egg: 
Tracking a Spy through the Maze of Computer Espionage," Doubleday (1989).

13.2  SOME SPECIFIC RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS


In addition, there are a number of resources on the Internet aimed 
specifically at elementary and secondary students and teachers.  You can 
use these to set up science experiments with classes in another country, 
learn how to use computers in the classroom or keep up with the latest 
advances in teaching everything from physics to physical education. 

Among them:
                           
ArtsEdge        Federally sponsored Online arts resources for students
                and teachers, it's available on the web at
               
                http://k12.cnidr.org/janice_k12/artsedge/artsedge2.html

Ask Dr. Math    Math professors and college students help k12 students
                with tough math questions.  Students can ask questions
                by e-mail and browse past answers on the Web.  The
                e-mail address is dr.math@forum.swarthmore.edu; the Web 
                url http://olmo.swarthmore.edu/dr-math/dr-math.html

AskERIC         Run by the Educational Resource and Information Center, 
                AskERIC provides a way for educators, librarians and 
                others interested in K-12 education to get more 
                information about virtually everything.  The center 
                maintains an e-mail address (askeric@ericir.syr.edu) for 
                questions and promises answers within 48 hours.  It also 
                maintains a Web site that contains digests of 
                questions and answers, lesson plans in a variety of 
                fields and other educationally related information.  The 
                Web address is http://ericir.syr.edu/. 

Health-Ed       A mailing list for health educators.  Send a request to 
                health-ed-request@stjhmc.fidonet.org 
 
K12Net          Begun on the Fidonet hobbyist network, K12Net is now also 
                carried on many Usenet systems and provides a host of 
                interesting and valuable services.  These include 
                international chat for students, foreign-language 
                discussions (for example, there are French and Germanonly conference where American students can practice 
                those languages with students from Quebec and German).  
                There are also conferences aimed at teachers of specific 
                subjects, from physical education to physics. The K12 
                network still has limited distribution, so ask your 
                system administrator if your system carries it.

MicroMUSE       This is an online, futuristic city, built entirely by
                participants (see chapter 12 for information on MUSEs
                and MUDs in general).  Hundreds of students from all
                over have participated in this educational exercise,
                coordinated by MIT. Telnet to michael.ai.mit.edu.
                Log on as guest and then follow the prompts for more 
                information. 

NASA Spacelink  This system, run by NASA in Huntsville, Ala., 
                provides all sorts of reports and data about NASA, its 
                history and its various missions, past and present.  
                Telnet spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov or 128.158.13.250. 
                     When you connect, you'll be given an overview of the 
                system and asked to register. The system maintains a 
                large file library of GIF-format space graphics, but note 
                that you can't download these through telnet. If you want 
                to, you have to dial the system directly, at (205) 8950028.  Many can be obtained through ftp from 
                ames.arc.nasa.gov, however. 

Newton          Run by the Argonne National Laboratory, it offers 
                conferences for teachers and students, including one 
                called "Ask a Scientist."  
 
                     Telnet: newton.dep.anl.gov.  
                     Log in as: cocotext 
 
                You'll be asked to provide your name and address.  When 
                you get the main menu, hit 4 for the various conferences.  
                The "Ask a Scientist" category lets you ask questions of 
                scientists in fields from biology to earth science.  
                Other categories let you discuss teaching, sports and 
                computer networks. 
 
OERI            The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Educational 
                Resources and Improvement runs a gopher system that 
                provides numerous educational resources, information and 
                statistics for teachers.  Use gopher to connect to

                     gopher.ed.gov. 

Spacemet Forum  If your system doesn't carry the K12 conferences, but 
                does provide you with telnet, you can reach the 
                conferences through SpaceMet Forum, a bulletin-board 
                system aimed at teachers and students that is run by the 
                physics and astronomy department at the University of 
                Massachusetts at Amherst.  
                
                     Telnet: spacemet.phast.umass.edu. 
                
                When you connect, hit escape once, after which you'll be 
                asked to log on. Like K12Net, SpaceMet Forum began as a 
                Fidonet system, but has since grown much larger.  Mort 
                and Helen Sternheim, professors at the university, 
                started SpaceMet as a one-line bulletin-board system 
                several years ago to help bolster middle-school science 
                education in nearby towns. 
                     In addition to the K12 conferences, SpaceMet carries 
                numerous educationally oriented conferences.  It also has 
                a large file library of interest to educators and 
                students, but be aware that getting files to your site 
                could be difficult and maybe even impossible.  Unlike 
                most other Internet sites, Spacemet does not use an ftp 
                interface. The Sternheims say ZMODEM sometimes works over 
                the network, but don't count on it. 

Yahoo           This Stanford University web service provides an archive of
                links to other educational resources on the net at

13.3  USENET AND BITNET IN THE CLASSROOM


There are numerous Usenet newsgroups of potential interest to 
teachers and students.  

As you might expect, many are of a scientific bent. You can find these by 
typing l sci. in rn or using nngrep sci. for nn. There are now close to 
40, with subjects ranging from archaeology to economics (the "dismal 
science," remember?) to astronomy to nanotechnology (the construction of 
microscopically small machines). 

One thing students will quickly learn from many of these groups: science 
is not just dull, boring facts.  Science is argument and standing your 
ground and making your case.  The Usenet sci. groups encourage critical 
thinking. 

Beyond science, social-studies and history classes can keep busy learning 
about other countries, through the soc.culture newsgroups. 

Most of these newsgroups originated as ways for expatriates of a given 
country to keep in touch with their homeland and its culture.  In times 
of crisis, however, these groups often become places to disseminate 
information from or into the country and to discuss what is happening.  
From Afghanistan to Yugoslavia, close to 50 countries are now represented 
on Usenet.  To see which groups are available, use l soc.culture. in rn 
or nngrep soc.culture. for nn. 

Several "talk" newsgroups provide additional topical discussions, but 
teachers should screen them first before recommending them to students.  
They range from talk.abortion and talk.politics.guns to 
talk.politics.space and talk.environment. 

One caveat:  Teachers might want to peruse particular newsgroups before 
setting their students loose in them.  Some have higher levels of flaming 
and blather than others, not to mention content that some might not 
consider appropriate in a school setting.  Some schools have developed 
"contracts" that students are required to sign that set out acceptable 
Net behavior. 

There are also a number of Bitnet discussion groups of potential interest 
to students and teachers.  See Chapter 5 for information on finding and 
subscribing to Bitnet discussion groups.  Some with an educational 
orientation include: 
 
biopi-l     ksuvm.bitnet        Secondary biology education
chemed-l    uwf.bitnet          Chemistry education
dts-l       iubvm.bitnet        The Dead Teacher's Society list
phys-l      uwf.bitnet          Discussions for physics teachers
physhare    psuvm.bitnet        Where physics teachers share resources
scimath-l   psuvm.bitnet        Science and math education

To get a list of ftp sites that carry astronomical images in the GIF 
graphics format, use ftp to connect to nic.funet.fi. Switch to the 
/pub/astro/general directory and get the file astroftp.txt.  Among the 
sites listed is ames.arc.nasa.gov, which carries images taken by the 
Voyager and Galileo probes, among other pictures.





CHAPTER 14: BUSINESS ON THE NET



1.2 GO!

 
Once, only people who studied or worked at an institution directly tied 
to the Net could connect to the world.  Today, though, an ever-growing 
number of "public-access" systems provide access for everybody.  These 
systems can now be found in most metropolitan areas (at least in North 
America) several states, and there are several companies a couple of 
sites that can provide access across the country. 

   

Some sites are run by for-profit companies; others by non-profit 
organizations.  Some of these public-access, or host, systems, are free 
of charge.  Others charge a monthly or yearly fee for unlimited access.  
And a few charge by the hour. Systems that charge for access will usually 
let you sign up online with a credit card.  Some also let you set up a 
billing system if you'd rather pay by check. 

But cost should be only one consideration in choosing a host system, 
especially if you live in an area with more than one provider.  Most 
systems let you look around before you sign up.  What is the range of 
each of their services?  How easy is each to use? What kind of support or 
help can you get from the system administrators? 

The last two questions are particularly important because many     
systems provide no user interface at all; when you connect, you are 
dumped right into the Unix operating system.  If you're already familiar 
with Unix, or you want to learn how to use it, these systems offer 
phenomenal power -- in addition to Net access, most also let you tap into 
the power of Unix to do everything from compiling your own programs to 
playing online games. 

But if you don't want to have to learn Unix, there are other publicaccess 
systems that work through menus (just like the ones in 
restaurants; you are shown a list of choices and then you make your 
selection of what you want), or which provide a "user interface" that is 
easier to figure out than the ever cryptic Unix (and fortunately, even on 
unix systems, there are ways to minimize your exposure to its commands, 
as we'll see in later chapters). 

Some systems also have their own unique 
local services, ranging from extensive conferences to large file 
libraries. 


1.6 IF YOUR TOWN HAS NO DIRECT ACCESS

If you don't live in an area with a public-access site, you'll still be 
able to connect to the Net.  Several services offer access through 
national data networks such as the CompuServe Packet Network and 
SprintNet, which have dozens, even hundreds of local dial-in numbers 
across the country.  These include Holonet in Berkeley, Calf., Portal in 
Cupertino, Calf., the WELL in Sausalito, Calf., Dial 'N CERF in San 
Diego, Calf., the World in Brookline, Mass., and Michnet in Ann Arbor, 
Mich.  Dial 'N CERF offers access through an 800 number.  Expect to pay 
from $2 to $12 an hour to use these networks, above each provider's basic 
charges.  The exact amount depends on the network, time of day and type 
of modem you use.  For more information, contact the above services. 

Four other providers deliver Net access to users across the country: 

Delphi, based in Cambridge, Mass., is a consumer-oriented network much 
like CompuServe or America Online -- only it now offers subscribers 
access to Internet services. Delphi charges $3 a month for Internet 
access, in addition to standard charges.  These are $10 a month for four 
hours of off-peak (non-working hours) access a month and $4 an hour for 
each additional hour or $20 for 20 hours of access a month and $1.80 an 
hour for each additional hour.  For more information, call (800) 6954005. 

BIX (the Byte Information Exchange) offers FTP, Telnet and e-mail access 
to the Internet as part of their basic service. Owned by the same company 
as Delphi, it also offers 20 hours of access a month for $20.  For more 
information, call (800) 695-4775.              

PSI, based in Reston, Va., provides nationwide access to Internet 
services through scores of local dial-in numbers to owners of IBM and 
compatible computers.  PSILink. which includes access to e-mail, Usenet 
and ftp, costs $29 a month, plus a one-time $19 registration fee.  
Special software is required, but is available free from PSI. PSI's 
Global Dialup Service provides access to telnet for $39 a month plus a 
one-time $39 set-up fee.  For more information, call (800) 82PSI82 or 
(703) 620-6651. 

NovX Systems Integration, based in Seattle, Washington, offers full 
Internet access through an 800 number reachable across the United States. 
There is a $24. setup fee, in addition to a monthly fee of $19.95 and a 
$10.5 hourly charge.  For more information, call (206) 447-0800. 


1.7  NET ORIGINS


In the 1960s, researchers began experimenting with linking computers to 
each other through telephone hook-ups, using funds from the 
U.S Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). 

ARPA wanted to see if computers in different locations could be linked 
using a new technology known as packet switching. This technology, in 
which data meant for another location is broken up into little pieces, 
each with its own "forwarding address" had the promise of letting several 
users share just one communications line.  Just as important, from ARPA's 
viewpoint, was that this allowed for creation of networks that could 
automatically route data around downed circuits or computers.  ARPA's 
goal was not the creation of today's international computer-using 
community, but development of a data network that could survive a nuclear 
attack. 

Previous computer networking efforts had required a line between each 
computer on the network, sort of like a one-track train route. The packet 
system allowed for creation of a data highway, in which large numbers of 
vehicles could essentially share the same lane.  Each packet was given 
the computer equivalent of a map and a time stamp, so that it could be 
sent to the right destination, where it would then be reassembled into a 
message the computer or a human could use. 

This system allowed computers to share data and the researchers to 
exchange electronic mail, or e-mail.  In itself, e-mail was something of 
a revolution, offering the ability to send detailed letters at the speed 
of a phone call. 

As this system, known as ARPANet, grew, some enterprising college 
students (and one in high school) developed a way to use it to conduct 
online conferences.  These started as science-oriented discussions, but 
they soon branched out into virtually every other field, as people 
recognized the power of being able to "talk" to hundreds, or even 
thousands, of people around the country. 

In the 1970s, ARPA helped support the development of rules, or protocols, 
for transferring data between different types of computer networks.  
These "internet" (from "internetworking") protocols made it possible to 
develop the worldwide Net we have today that links all sorts of computers 
across national boundaries. By the close of the 1970s, links developed 
between ARPANet and counterparts in other countries.  The world was now 
tied together in a computer web.  

In the 1980s, this network of networks, which became known collectively 
as the Internet, expanded at a phenomenal rate.  Hundreds, then 
thousands, of colleges, research companies and government agencies began 
to connect their computers to this worldwide Net.  Some enterprising 
hobbyists and companies unwilling to pay the high costs of Internet 
access (or unable to meet stringent government regulations for access) 
learned how to link their own systems to the Internet, even if "only" for 
e-mail and conferences.  Some of these systems began offering access to 
the public. Now anybody with a computer and modem, persistance and a 
small amount of money -- and persistence -- could tap into the world. 

In the 1990s, the Net continues to grow at exponential rates.  Some 
estimates are that the volume of messages transferred through the Net 
grows 20 percent a month.  In response, government and other users have 
tried in recent years to expand the Net itself.  Once, the main Net 
"backbone" in the U.S. moved data at 56,000 bits per second. That proved 
too slow for the ever increasing amounts of data being sent over it, and 
in recent years the maximum speed was increased to 1.5 million and then 
45 million bits per second. Even before the Net was able to reach that 
latter speed, however, Net experts were already figuring out ways to pump 
data at speeds of up to 2 billion bits per second -- fast enough to send 
the entire Encyclopedia Britannica across the country in just one or two 
seconds.  Another major change has been the development of commercial 
services that provide internetworking services at speeds comparable to 
those of the government system.  In fact, what started as a government 
experiment is now largely a private enterprise.


1.8  HOW IT WORKS
 

The worldwide Net is actually a complex web of smaller regional networks.  
To understand it, picture a modern road network of trans-continental 
superhighways connecting large cities.  From these large cities come 
smaller freeways and parkways to link together small towns, whose 
residents travel on slower, narrow residential ways.  

The Net superhighway is the high-speed Internet.  Connected to this are 
computers that use a particular system of transferring data at high 
speeds.  In the U.S., the major Internet "backbones" theoretically can 
move data at rates of 45 million bits per second (compare this to the 
average home modem, which has a top speed of roughly 9,600 to 14,400 bits 
per second).  Connected to the backbone computers are smaller networks 
serving particular geographic regions, which generally move data at 
speeds around 1.5 million bits per second.  Feeding off these in turn are 
even smaller networks or individual computers. 

Unlike with commercial networks such as CompuServe or Prodigy, there is 
no one central computer or computers running the Internet -- its 
resources are to be found among thousands of individual computers.  This 
is both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness.   The approach 
means it is virtually impossible for the entire Net to crash at once -- 
even if one computer shuts down, the rest of the network stays up.  The 
design also reduces the costs for an individual or organization to get 
onto the network.  However, thousands of connected computers can also 
make it difficult to navigate the Net and find what you want -- 
especially as different computers may have different commands for 
plumbing their resources.  It is only recently that Net users have begun 
to develop the sorts of navigational tools and "maps" that will let 
neophytes get around without getting lost. 

Nobody really knows how many computers and networks actually make up this 
Net.  Some estimates say there are now as many as 12,000 networks 
connecting nearly 4 million computers and more than 20 million 
people around the world.  Whatever the actual numbers, however, it is 
clear they are only increasing.   

The Net is more than just a technological marvel. It is human 
communication at its most fundamental level.  The pace may be a little 
quicker when the messages race around the world in a few seconds, but 
it's not much different from a large and interesting party. You'll see 
things in cyberspace that will make you laugh; you'll see things that 
will anger you.  You'll read silly little snippets and new ideas that 
WILL make you think.  You'll make new friends and meet people you wish 
would just go away. And you'll do it all in a community that transcends 
state lines and national borders.
 
major network providers continue to work on ways to make it 
easier for users of one network to communicate with those of another.  
Work is underway on a system for providing a universal "white pages" 
in which you could look up somebody's electronic-mail address, for 
example.  This connectivity trend will likely speed up in coming years 
as users begin to demand seamless network access, much as telephone 
users can now dial almost anywhere in the world without worrying about 
how many phone companies actually have to connect their calls. 

Today, the links grow ever closer between the Internet and such 
commercial networks as CompuServe and Prodigy, whose users can now 
exchange electronic mail with their Internet friends.  All of the major 
commercial networks, such as CompuServe and America Online are gradually 
bringing internet access to their users (one network, Delphi, already 
offers complete access). 

And as it becomes easier to use, more and more people will join this 
worldwide community we call the Net. 

Being connected to the Net takes more than just reading conferences and 
logging messages to your computer; it takes asking and answering 
questions, exchanging opinions -- getting involved. 

If you chose to go forward, to use and contribute, you will become a 
citizen of Cyberspace.  If you're reading these words for the first time, 
this may seem like an amusing but unlikely notion -- that one could 
"inhabit" a place without physical space.  But put a mark beside these 
words.  Join the Net and actively participate for a year.  Then re-read 
this passage.  It will no longer seem so strange to be a "citizen of 
Cyberspace."  It will seem like the most natural thing in the world.   

And that leads to another fundamental thing to remember: 
 
                You can't break the Net!
 
As you travel the Net, your computer may freeze, your screen may erupt 
into a mass of gibberish.  You may think you've just disabled a milliondollar computer somewhere -- or even your own personal computer.  Sooner 
or later, this feeling happens to everyone -- and likely more than once. 
But the Net and your computer are hardier than you think, so relax.  You 
can no more break the Net than you can the phone system.  If something 
goes wrong, try again.  If nothing at all happens, you can always 
disconnect.   If worse comes to worse, you can turn off your computer.  
Then take a deep breath.  And dial right back in. Leave a note for the 
person who runs the computer to which you've connected to ask for advice.  
Try it again. Persistence pays.  

Stay and contribute.  The Net will be richer for it -- and so will you.        


2.2  ELM -- A BETTER WAY 

 
Elm is a combination mailbox and letter-writing system that uses menus to 
help you navigate through mail.  Most Unix-based host systems now have it 
online. To use it, type 
  
     elm 
 
and hit enter.  You'll get a menu of your waiting mail, along with a list 
of commands you can execute, that will look something like this: 
 
 
     Mailbox is '/usr/spool/mail/adamg' with 38 messages [ELM 2.3 PL11]      
                                                                               
                                                                               
                                                                               
 You can use any of the following commands by pressing the first character;  
d)elete or u)ndelete mail,  m)ail a message,  r)eply or f)orward mail,  q)uit 
  To read a message, press <return>.  j = move down, k = move up, ? = help   
 

Each line shows the date you received the message, who sent it, how many 
lines long the message is, and the message's subject. 

If you are using VT100 or similar emulation, you can move up and down the 
menu with your up and down arrow keys.  Otherwise, type the line number 
of the message you want to read or delete and hit enter. 

When you read a message, it pauses every 24 lines, instead of scrolling 
until it's done.  Hit the space bar to read the next page.  You can type 
a lowercase r to reply or a lower-case q or i to get back to the menu 
(the I stands for "index").  

At the main menu, hitting a lowercase m followed by enter will let you 
start a message.  To delete a message, type a lower-case d.  You can do 
this while reading the message.  Or, if you are in the menu, move the 
cursor to the message's line and then hit d. 

When you're done with elm, type a lower-case q.  The program will ask if 
you really want to delete the messages you marked. Then, it will ask you 
if you want to move any messages you've read but haven't marked for 
deletion to a "received" file.  For now, hit your n key.  Elm has 
a potentially major disadvantage for the beginner. The default text 
editor it often generally calls up when you hit your r or m key is often 
a program called emacs. Unixoids swear by emacs, but everybody else 
almost always finds it impossible.  Unfortunately, you can't always get 
away from it (or vi, another text editor often found on Unix systems), so 
later on we'll talk about some basic commands that will keep you from 
going totally nuts.  If you're lucky, though, your system administrator 
will have changed emacs to Pico, a much easier to use text processor 
(more on that in the Pine section below).

If you want to save a message to your own computer, hit s, either within 
the message or with your cursor on the message entry in the elm menu.  A 
filename will pop up.  If you do not like it, type a new name (you won't 
have to backspace).  Hit enter, and the message will be saved with that 
file name in your "home directory" on your host system.  After you exit 
elm, you can now download it (ask your system administrator for specifics 
on how to download -- and upload -- such files). 

 
2.3  PINE -- AN EVEN BETTER WAY

Pine is based on elm but includes a number of improvements that make it 
an ideal mail system for beginners.   Like elm, pine starts you with a 
menu.  It also has an "address book" feature that is handy for people 
with long or complex e-mail addresses. Hitting A at the main menu puts 
you in the address book, where you can type in the person's first name 
(or nickname) followed by her address. Then, when you want to send that 
person a message, you only have to type in her first name or nickname, 
and Pine automatically inserts her actual address. The address book 
also lets you set up a mailing list.  This feature allows you to send the 
same message to a number of people at once. 

What really sets Pine apart is its built-in text editor, which looks and 
feels a lot more like word-processing programs available for MS-DOS and 
Macintosh users.  Not only does it have word wrap (a revolutionary 
concept if ever there was one), it also has a spell-checker and a search 
command. Best of all, all of the commands you need are listed in a twoline mini-menu at the bottom of each screen.  The commands look like 
this: 
 
     ^W Where is 
 
The little caret is a synonym for the key marked "control" on your 
keyboard.  To find where a particular word is in your document, hit 
control-w (depress your control key, then hit w) you'd hit your control 
key and your W key at the same time, which would bring up a prompt asking 
you for the word to look for.  Some of Pine's commands are a tad peculiar 
(control-V for "page down" for example), which comes from being based on 
a variant of the emacs text processor (which is utterly peculiar).  But 
again, all of the commands you need are listed on that two-line minimenu, so it shouldn't take you more than a couple of seconds to find the 
right one.  To use Pine, type 
 
     pine 
 
at the command line and hit enter.                     
 
 
2.4  SMILEYS
 
 
When you're involved in an online discussion, you can't see the smiles or 
shrugs that the other person might make in a live conversation to show 
he's only kidding.  But online, there's no body language. So what you 
might think is funny, somebody else might take as an insult.  To try to 
keep such misunderstandings from erupting into bitter disputes, we have 
smileys.  Tilt your head to the left and look at the following sideways. 
:-).  Or simply :).  This is your basic "smiley." Use it to indicate 
people should not take that comment you just made as seriously as they 
might otherwise.  You make a smiley by typing a colon, a hyphen and a 
right parenthetical bracket. Some people prefer using the word "grin," 
usually in this form: 
 
     <grin>   
 
Sometimes, though, you'll see it as *grin* or even just <g> for short. 
 
Some other smileys include: 
 
     ;-)      Wink; 
     :-(      Frown; 
     :-O      Surprise; 
     8-)      Wearing glasses; 
     =|:-)=   Abe Lincoln. 
    
OK, so maybe the last two are a little bogus :-).
 

2.5  SENDING E-MAIL TO OTHER NETWORKS
 
 
There are a number of computer networks that are not directly part of the 
Net, but which are now connected through "gateways" that allow the 
passing of e-mail.  Here's a list of some of the larger networks, how to 
send mail to them and how their users can send mail to you: 
 
America Online 
--------------
 
Remove any spaces from a user's name and append "@aol.com," to get 
 
     user@aol.com 
 
America Online users who want to send mail to you need only put your 
Net address in the "to:" field before composing a message. 
 
 
ATTMail 
-------
 
Address your message to user@attmail.com. 
   
From ATTMail, a user would send mail to you in this form: 
 
     internet!domain!user 
 
So if your address were nancyr@world.std.com, your correspondent would 
send a message to you at 
 
     internet!world.std.com!nancyr 
 
 
Bitnet 
------
     
Users of Bitnet (and NetNorth in Canada and EARN in Europe) often have 
addresses in this form: IZZY@INDVMS.  If you're lucky, all you'll have to 
do to mail to that address is add "bitnet" at the end, to get 
izzy@indvms.bitnet.  Sometimes, however, mail to such an address will 
bounce back to you, because Bitnet addresses do not always translate well 
into an Internet form.  If this happens, you can send mail through one of 
two Internet/Bitnet gateways. First, change the @ in the address to a %, 
so that you get username%site.bitnet.  Then add either @vm.marist.edu or 
@cunyvm.cuny.edu, so that, with the above example, you would get 
izzy%indyvms.bitnet@vm.marist.edu or izzy%indvyvms.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu 

Bitnet users have it a little easier: They can usually send mail directly 
to your e-mail address without fooling around with it at all.  So send 
them your address and they should be OK. 
 
 
CompuServe 
----------
 
CompuServe users have numerical addresses in this form: 73727,545. 
To send mail to a CompuServe user, change the comma to a period and add 
"@compuserve.com"; for example: 73727.545@compuserve.com. 

Note that many CompuServe users must pay extra to receive mail from the 
Internet. 

If you know CompuServe users who want to send you mail, tell them to GO 
MAIL and create a mail message. In the address area, instead of typing in 
a CompuServe number, have them type your address in this form: 
 
     INTERNET:YourID@YourAddress. 
 
For example, INTERNET:adamg@world.std.com.                  

 
Delphi
------
 
To send mail to a Delphi user, the form is username@delphi.com. 
 
Fidonet 
-------
 
To send mail to people using a Fidonet BBS, you need the name they use to 
log onto that system and its "node number.''  Fidonet node numbers or 
addresses consist of three numbers, in this form: 1:322/190.  The first 
number tells which of several broad geographic zones the BBS is in (1 
represents the U.S. and Canada, 2 Europe and Israel, 3 Pacific Asia, 4 
South America).  The second number represents the BBS's network, while 
the final number is the BBS's "FidoNode'' number in that network. If your 
correspondent only gives you two numbers (for example, 322/190), it means 
the system is in zone 1.   

Now comes the tricky part. You have to reverse the numbers and add to 
them the letters f, n and z (which stand for "FidoNode,''"network,'' and 
"zone'). For example, the address above would become 
 
     f190.n322.z1. 
 
Now add "fidonet.org'' at the end, to get f190.n322.z1.fidonet.org. Then 
add "FirstName.LastName@', to get 
 
     FirstName.LastName@f190.n322.z1.fidonet.org
 
Note the period between the first and last names. Also, some countries 
now have their own Fidonet "backbone" systems, which might affect 
addressing.  For example, were the above address in Germany, you would 
end it with "fido.de" instead of "fidonet.org." 
     
Whew! 

The reverse process is totally different. First, the person has to have 
access to his or her BBS's "net mail" area and know the Fidonet address 
of his or her local Fidonet/UUCP gateway (often their system operator 
will know it).  Your Fidonet correspondent should address a net-mail 
message to UUCP (not your name) in the "to:" field.  In the node-number 
field, they should type in the node number of the Fidonet/UUCP gateway 
(if the gateway system is in the same regional network as their system, 
they need only type the last number, for example, 390 instead of 
322/390).  Then, the first line of the message has to be your Internet 
address, followed by a blank line.  After that, the person can write the 
message and send it.  

Because of the way Fidonet moves mail, it could take a day or two for a 
message to be delivered in either direction.  Also, because many Fidonet 
systems are run as hobbies, it is considered good form to ask the gateway 
sysop's permission if you intend to pass large amounts of mail back and 
forth. Messages of a commercial nature are strictly forbidden (even if 
it's something the other person asked for). Also, consider it very likely 
that somebody other than the recipient will read your messages. 
 
 
GEnie  
-----

To send mail to a GEnie user, add "@genie.geis.com" to the end of the 
GEnie user name, for example: walt@genie.geis.com. 
 
MCIMail 
-------
 
To send mail to somebody with an MCIMail account, add "@mcimail.com to 
the end of their name or numerical address. For example: 
       
     555-1212@mcimail.com 
 
or 
     
     jsmith@mcimail.com 
 
Note that if there is more than one MCIMail subscriber with that name, 
you will get a mail message back from MCI giving you their names and 
numerical addresses. You'll then have to figure out which one you want 
and re-send the message. 
 
From MCI, a user would type 
 
     Your Name (EMS) 
 
at the "To:" prompt.  At the EMS prompt, he or she would type 
 
    internet 
 
followed by your Net address at the "Mbx:" prompt. 
 
Prodigy 
------- 
     
UserID@prodigy.com.  Note that Prodigy users must pay extra for 
Internet e-mail. 


2.6  SEVEN UNIX COMMANDS YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT

 
If you connect to the Net through a Unix system, eventually you'll have 
to come to terms with Unix.  For better or worse, most Unix systems do 
NOT shield you from their inner workings -- if you want to copy a Usenet 
posting to a file, for example, you'll have to use some Unix commands if 
you ever want to do anything with that file. 

Like MS-DOS, Unix is an operating system - it tells the computer how to 
do things.  Now while Unix may have a reputation as being even more 
complex than MS-DOS, in most cases, a few basic, and simple, commands 
should be all you'll ever need. 

If your own computer uses MS-DOS or PC-DOS, the basic concepts will seem 
very familiar -- but watch out for the cd command, which works 
differently enough from the similarly named DOS command that it will 
drive you crazy.  Also, unlike MS-DOS, Unix is case sensitive -- if you 
type commands or directory names in the wrong case, you'll get an error 
message. 

If you're used to working on a Mac, you'll have to remember that Unix 
stores files in "directories" rather than "folders."  Unix directories 
are organized like branches on a tree. At the bottom is the "root" 
directory, with sub-directories branching off that (and sub-directories 
in turn can have sub-directories). 
The Mac equivalent of a Unix subdirectory is a folder within another folder. 
 
2.7  WHEN THINGS GO WRONG                  
 
     
* You send a message but get back an ominous looking message from 
MAILER-DAEMON containing up to several dozen lines of computerese 
followed by your message.  

Somewhere in those lines you can often find a clue to what went 
wrong.  You might have made a mistake in spelling the e-mail address.  
The site to which you're sending mail might have been down for 
maintenance or a problem. You may have used the wrong "translation" for 
mail to a non-Internet network. 

* You call up your host system's text editor to write a message or reply 
to one and can't seem to get out.  

If it's emacs, try control-X, control-C DELETE(in other words, hit your 
control key and your X key at the same time, followed by control and C).  
If worse comes to worse, you can hang up. 

* In elm, you accidentally hit the D key for a message you want to save.  

Type the number of the message, hit enter and then U, which will "undelete" the message.  This works only before you exit Elm; once you quit, 
the message is gone. 

* You try to upload an ASCII message you've written on your own computer 
into a message you're preparing in Elm or Pine and you get a lot of left 
brackets, capital Ms, Ks and Ls and some funny-looking characters.  

Believe it or not, your message may actually wind up looking fine; all 
that garbage is temporary and reflects the problems some Unix text 
processors have with ASCII uploads.  But it will take much longer for 
your upload to finish.  One way to deal with this is to call up the 
simple mail program, which will not produce any weird characters when you 
upload a text file into a message.  Another way (which is better if your 
prepared message is a response to somebody's mail), is to create a text 
file on your host system with cat, for example, 
 
     cat>file
 
and then upload your text into that.  Then, in elm or pine, you can 
insert the message with a simple command (control-R in pine, for 
example); only this time you won't see all that extraneous stuff. 
     
*  You haven't cleared out your Elm mailbox in awhile, and you 
accidentally hit "y" when you meant to hit "n" (or vice-versa) when 
exiting and now all your messages have disappeared.

The system has put all the messages in a file called received in your 
Mail directory.  To get to the messages, call up Elm again, and hit your 
c key.  You'll be asked which folder to change to.  Type 

     =received

and hit enter.  You'll be prompted as if you're about to exit Elm; when 
done answering the questions, you'll get a menu of messages in your 
receive folder.  You can reply to them, delete them, etc., as you would 
normally. 







3.2 NAVIGATING USENET WITH nn


How do you dive right in?  As mentioned, on some systems, it's all done 
through menus -- you just keep choosing from a list of choices until you 
get to the newsgroup you want and then hit the "read" command.  On Unix 
systems, however, you will have to use a "newsreader" program.  Two of 
the more common ones are known as rn (for "read news") and nn (for "no 
news" -- because it's supposed to be simpler to use). 

For beginners, nn may be the better choice because it works with menus -- 
you get a list of articles in a given newsgroup and then you choose which 
ones you want to see.  To try it out, connect to your host system and, at 
the command line, type 
 
     nn news.announce.newusers
 
and hit enter.  After a few seconds, you should see something like this: 
 
Newsgroup: news.announce.newusers                     Articles: 22 of 22/1 NEW 
 
Obviously, this is a good newsgroup to begin your exploration of Usenet!  
Here's what all this means:  The first letter on each line is the letter 
you type to read that particular "article" (it makes sense that a 
"newsgroup" would have "articles").  Next comes the name of the person 
who wrote that article, followed by its length, in lines, and what the 
article is about. At the bottom, you see the local time at your access 
site, what you're doing right now (i.e., SELECTing articles), which key 
to hit for some help (the ? key) and how many of the articles in the 
newsgroup you can see on this screen. The "(moderated)" means the 
newsgroup has a "moderator" who is the only one who can directly post 
messages to it.  This is generally limited to groups such as this, which 
contain articles of basic information, or for digests, which are 
basically online magazines (more on them in a bit). 

Say you're particularly interested in what "Emily Postnews" has to say 
about proper etiquette on Usenet. Hit your c key (lower case!), and the 
line will light up.  If you want to read something else, hit the key that 
corresponds to it.  And if you want to see what's on the next page of 
articles, hit return or your space bar. 

But you're impatient to get going, and you want to read that article now.  
The command for that in nn is a capital Z.  

The first few lines are the message's header, similar to the header you 
get in e-mail messages.  Then comes the beginning of the message.  The 
last line tells you the time again, the newsgroup name (or part of it, 
anyway), the position in your message stack that this message occupies, 
how to get help, and how much of the message is on screen.  If you want 
to keep reading this message, just hit your space bar (not your enter 
key!) for the next screen and so on until done. When done, you'll be 
returned to the newsgroup menu.  For now hit Q (upper case this time), 
which quits you out of nn and returns you to your host system's command 
line. 

To get a look at another interesting newsgroup, type 
 
     nn comp.risks
 
and hit enter.  This newsgroup is another moderated group, this time a 
digest of all the funny and frightening ways computers and the people who 
run and use them can go wrong.  Again, you read articles by selecting 
their letters.  If you're in the middle of an article and decide you want 
to go onto the next one, hit your n key. 
     
Now it's time to look for some newsgroups that might be of particular 
interest to you.  Unix host systems that have nn use a program called 
nngrep (ever get the feeling Unix was not entirely written in English?) 
that lets you scan newsgroups.  Exit nn and at your host system's command 
line, type 
 
     nngrep word
 
where word is the subject you're interested in.  If you use a Macintosh 
computer, you might try
 
     nngrep mac
 
 
Note that some of these obviously have something to do with Macintoshes 
while some obviously do not; nngrep is not a perfect system.  If you want 
to get a list of ALL the newsgroups available on your host system, type 
 
     nngrep -a |more
 
or

     nngrep -a |pg
 
and hit enter (which one to use depends on the Unix used on your host 
system; if one doesn't do anything, try the other). You don't absolutely 
need the |more or |pg, but if you don't include it, the list will keep 
scrolling, rather than pausing every 24 lines.  If you are in nn, hitting 
a capital Y will bring up a similar list. 

Typing "nn newsgroup" for every newsgroup can get awfully tiring after 
awhile.  When you use nn, your host system looks in a file called 
.newsrc.  This is basically a list of every newsgroup on the host system 
along with notations on which groups and articles you have read (all 
maintained by the computer).  You can also use this file to create a 
"reading list" that brings up each newsgroup to which you want to 
"subscribe."  To try it out, type 
 
     nn
 
without any newsgroup name, and hit enter.  
     
Unfortunately, you will start out with a .newsrc file that has you 
"subscribed" to every single newsgroup on your host system!  To delete a 
newsgroup from your reading list, type a capital U while its menu is on 
the screen.  The computer will ask you if you're sure you want to 
"unsubscribe."  If you then hit a Y, you'll be unsubscribed and put in 
the next group. 

With many host systems carrying thousands of newsgroups, this will take 
you forever.  

Fortunately, there are a couple of easier ways to do this.  Both involve 
calling up your .newsrc file in a word or text processor.  In a .newsrc 
file, each newsgroup takes up one line, consisting of the group's name, 
an exclamation point or a colon and a range of numbers.  Newsgroups with 
a colon are ones to which you are subscribed; those followed by an 
exclamation point are "un-subscribed."  To start with a clean slate, 
then, you have to change all those colons to exclamation points. 

If you know how to use emacs or vi, call up the .newsrc file (you might 
want to make a copy of .newsrc first, just in case), and use the searchand-replace function to make the change. 

If you're not comfortable with these text processor, you can download the 
.newsrc file, make the changes on your own computer and then upload the 
revised file.  Before you download the file, however, you should do a 
couple of things.  One is to type 
 
     cp .newsrc temprc
 
and hit enter.  You will actually download this temprc file (note the 
name does not start with a period -- some computers, such as those using 
MS-DOS, do not allow file names starting with periods).  After you 
download the file, open it in your favorite word processor and use its 
search-and-replace function to change the exclamation points to colons. 
Be careful not to change anything else!  Save the document in ASCII or 
text format.  Dial back into your host system.  At the command line, type 
 
     cp temprc temprc1
 
and hit enter.  This new file will serve as your backup .newsrc file 
just in case something goes wrong. Upload the temprc file from your 
computer.  This will overwrite the Unix system's old temprc file.  Now 
type 
 
     cp temprc .newsrc
 
and hit enter.  You now have a clean slate to start creating a reading 
list.

3.3  nn COMMANDS

 
To mark a specific article for reading, type the letter next to it (in lower 
case).  To mark a specific article and all of its responses, type the letter 
and an asterisk, for example: 
 
     a* 
 
To un-select an article, type the letter next to it (again, in lower case). 
 
C               Cancels an article (around the world) that you wrote.  
                Every article posted on Usenet has a unique ID number.  
                Hitting a capital C sends out a new message that tells host 
                systems that receive it to find earlier message and delete 
                it. 
 
F               To post a public response, or follow-up. If selected while 
                still on a newsgroup "page", asks you which article to 
                follow up.  If selected while in a specific article, will 
                follow up that article. In either case, you'll be asked if 
                you want to include the original article in yours. Caution:
                puts you in whatever text editor is your default.
 
N               Goes to the next subscribed newsgroup with unread articles. 
 
P               Goes to the previous subscribed newsgroup with unread 
                articles. 
 
G news.group    Goes to a specific newsgroup. Can be used to subscribe to 
                new newsgroups.  Hitting G brings up a sub-menu: 
 
                          u     Goes to the group and shows only un-read 
                                articles. 
 
                          a     Goes to the group and shows all articles, 
                                even ones you've already read. 
 
                          s     Will show you only articles with a specific 
                                subject. 
 
                          n     Will show you only articles from a specific 
                                person. 
 
M               Mails a copy of the current article to somebody.  You'll be 
                asked for the recipient's e-mail address and whether you 
                want to add any comments to the article before sending it 
                off.  As with F, puts you in the default editor.
 
:post           Post an article. You'll be asked for the name of the group. 
 
Q               Quit, or exit, nn. 
 
U               Un-subscribe from the current newsgroup. 
 
R               Responds to an article via e-mail. 
 
space           Hitting the space bar brings up the next page of articles. 
 
X               If you have selected articles, this will show them to you 
                and then take you to the next subscribed newsgroup with 
                unread articles. If you don't have any selected articles, 
                it marks all articles as read and takes you to the next 
                unread subscribed newsgroup. 
 
=word           Finds and marks all articles in the newsgroup with a 
                specific word in the "subject:" line, for example: 
 
                          =modem 
 
Z               Shows you selected articles immediately and then returns 
                you to the current newsgroup. 
 
?               Brings up a help screen. 
 
<               Goes to the previous page in the newsgroup. 
 
>               Goes to the next page in the newsgroup. 
 
$               Goes to the last page in an article.
 
^               Goes to the first page in an article.
 
 
3.5  rn COMMANDS
 
 
Different commands are available to you in rn depending on whether you 
are already in a newsgroup or reading a specific article. At any point, 
typing a lowercase h will bring up a list of available commands and some 
terse instructions for using them. Here are some of them: 
 
After you've just called up rn, or within a newsgroup:
 
c             Marks every article in a newsgroup as read (or "caught up")
              so that you don't have to see them again. The system will ask 
              you if you are sure. Can be done either when asked if you
              want to read a particular newsgroup or once in the newsgroup.
 
g             Goes to a newsgroup, in this form: 
     
                        g news.group 
      
              Use this both for going to groups to which you're already 
              subscribed and subscribing to new groups. 
 
h             Provides a list of available commands with terse 
              instructions.
 
l             Gives a list of all available newsgroups.
 
p             Goes to the first previous subscribed newsgroup with un-read 
              articles. 
 
q             Quits, or exits, rn if you have not yet gone into a newsgroup. 
              If you are in a newsgroup, it quits that one and brings you to 
              the next subscribed newsgroup. 
 
Only within a newsgroup:
 
=             Gives a list of all available articles in the newsgroup.
 
 
m             Marks a specific article or series of articles as "un-read" 
              again so that you can come back to them later. Typing
 
                        1700m
 
              and hitting enter would mark just that article as un-read. 
              Typing 
 
                        1700-1800m
 
              and hitting enter would mark all of those articles as unread.
 
space         Brings up the next page of article listings.  If already on
              the last page, displays the first article in the newsgroup.
 
u             Un-subscribe from the newsgroup. 
 
/text/        Searches through the newsgroup for articles with a specific
              word or phrase in the "subject:" line, from the current 
              article to the end of the newsgroup. For example, 
 
                        /EFF/
 
              would bring you to the first article with "EFF" in the 
              "subject:" line.
 
?text?        The same as /text/ except it searches in reverse order from 
              the current article.
 
Only within a specific article:
 
e             Some newsgroups consist of articles that are binary files, 
              typically programs or graphics images.  Hitting e will convert 
              the ASCII characters within such an article into a file you
              can then download and use or view (assuming you have the proper
              computer and software).  Many times, such files will be split
              into several articles; just keep calling up the articles and
              hitting e until done.  You'll find the resulting file in your
              News subdirectory.

C             If you post an article and then decide it was a mistake, call 
              it up on your host system and hit this.  The message will soon 
              begin disappearing on systems around the world. 
 
F             Post a public response in the newsgroup to the current 
              article.  Includes a copy of her posting, which you can then 
              edit down using your host system's text editor. 
 
f             The same as above except it does not include a copy of the 
              original message in yours.
 
m             Marks the current article as "un-read" so that you can come 
              back to it later.  You do not have to type the article 
              number.       
 
Control-N     Brings up the first response to the article. If there is no 
              follow-up article, this returns you to the first unread article 
              in the newsgroup). 
 
Control-P     Goes to the message to which the current article is a reply.
 
n             Goes to the next unread article in the newsgroup. 
 
N             Takes you to the next article in the newsgroup even if you've 
              already read it.
 
q             Quits, or exits, the current article. Leaves you in the current 
              newsgroup.
 
R             Reply, via e-mail only, to the author of the current article. 
              Includes a copy of his message in yours.
 
r             The same as above, except it does not include a copy of his 
              article.
 
s file        Copies the current article to a file in your News directory, 
              where "file" is the name of the file you want to save it to. 
              You'll be asked if you want to use "mailbox" format when 
              saving. If you answer by hitting your N key, most of the 
              header will not be saved. 

s|mail user   Mails a copy of the article to somebody. For "user" substitute
              an e-mail address. Does not let you add comments to the 
              message first, however.
 
space         Hitting the space bar shows the next page of the article, or, if 
              at the end, goes to the next un-read article.


3.6  ESSENTIAL NEWSGROUPS


With so much to choose from, everybody will likely have their own unique 
Usenet reading list.  But there are a few newsgroups that are 
particularly of interest to newcomers.  Among them: 

     news.announce.newusers     This group consists of a series of
                                articles that explain various facets of
                                Usenet.

     news.newusers.questions    This is where you can ask questions 
                                (we'll see how in a bit) about how
                                Usenet works.

     news.announce.newsgroups   Look here for information about new or
                                proposed newsgroups.

     news.answers               Contains lists of "Frequently Asked
                                Questions"  (FAQs) and their answers from 
                                many different newsgroups.  Learn how to
                                fight jet lag in the FAQ from 
                                rec.travel.air; look up answers to common
                                questions about Microsoft Windows in
                                an FAQ from comp.os.ms-windows; etc.

     alt.internet.services      Looking for something in particular on 
                                the Internet?  Ask here.

     alt.infosystems.announce   People adding new information services to
                                the Internet will post details here.


3.7  SPEAKING UP


"Threads" are an integral part of Usenet.  When somebody posts a message, 
often somebody else will respond.  Soon, a thread of conversation begins.  
Following these threads is relatively easy.  In nn, related messages are 
grouped together.  In rn, when you're done with a message, you can hit 
control-N to read the next related message, or followup.  As you explore 
Usenet, it's probably a good idea to read discussions for awhile before 
you jump in.  This way, you can get a feel for the particular newsgroup 
-- each has its own rhythms. 
 
Eventually, though, you'll want to speak up.  There are two main ways to 
do this.  You join an existing conversation, or you can start a whole new 
thread. 

If you want to join a discussion, you have to decide if you want to 
include portions of the message you are responding to in your message.  
The reason to do this is so people can see what you're responding to, 
just in case the original message has disappeared from their system 
(remember that most Usenet messages have a short life span on the average 
host system) or they can't find it.  

If you're using a Unix host system, joining an existing conversation is 
similar in both nn and rn: hit your F key when done with a given article 
in the thread.  In rn, type a small f if you don't want to include 
portions of the message you're responding to; an uppercase F if you do. 
In nn, type a capital F.  You'll then be asked if you want to include 
portions of the original message. 

And here's where you hit another Unix wall.  When you hit your F key, 
your host system calls up its basic Unix text editor.  If you're lucky, 
that'll be pico, a very easy system.  More likely, however, you'll get 
dumped into emacs (or possibly vi), which you've already met in the 
chapter on e-mail.  

The single most important emacs command is 
 
     control-x control-c
 
This means, depress your control key and hit x.  Then depress the control 
key and hit c.  Memorize this.  In fact, it's so important, it bears 
repeating: 
     
     control-x control-c
 
These keystrokes are how you get out of emacs.  If they work well, you'll 
be asked if you want to send, edit, abort or list the message you were 
working on.  If they don't work well (say you accidentally hit some other 
weird key combination that means something special to emacs) and nothing 
seems to happen, or you just get more weird-looking emacs prompts on the 
bottom of your screen, try hitting control-g. This should stop whatever 
emacs was trying to do (you should see the word "quit" on the bottom of 
your screen), after which you can hit control-x control-c. But if this 
still doesn't work, remember that you can always disconnect and dial back 
in! 

If you have told your newsreader you do want to include portions of the 
original message in yours, it will automatically put the entire thing at 
the top of your message.  Use the arrow keys to move down to the lines 
you want to delete and hit control-K, which will delete one line at a 
time. 

You can then write your message.  Remember that you have to hit enter 
before your cursor gets to the end of the line, because emacs does not 
have word wrapping. 

When done, hit control-X control-C.  You'll be asked the question about 
sending, editing, aborting, etc.  Chose one.  If you hit Y, your host 
system will start the process to sending your message across the Net. 

The nn and rn programs work differently when it comes to posting entirely 
new messages.  In nn, type 
 
     :post
 
and hit enter in any newsgroup.  You'll be asked which newsgroup to 
post a message to.  Type in its name and hit enter.  Then you'll be 
asked for "keywords."  These are words you'd use to attract somebody 
scanning a newsgroup.  Say you're selling your car.  You might type 
the type of car here.  Next comes a "summary" line, which is somewhat 
similar.  Finally, you'll be asked for the message's "distribution."
This is where you put how widely you want your message disseminated.  
Think about this one for a second.  If you are selling your car, it 
makes little sense to send a message about it all over the world.  But 
if you want to talk about the environment, it might make a lot of 
sense.  Each host system has its own set of distribution 
classifications, but there's generally a local one (just for users of 
that system), one for the city, state or region it's in, another for 
the country (for example, usa), one for the continent (for Americans 
and Canadians, na) and finally, one for the entire world (usually: 
world).

Which one to use?  Generally, a couple of seconds' thought will help you 
decide.  If you're selling your car, use your city or regional 
distribution -- people in Australia won't much care and may even get 
annoyed.  If you want to discuss presidential politics, using a USA 
distribution makes more sense.  If you want to talk about events in the 
Middle East, sending your message to the entire world is perfectly 
acceptable. One caveat: these rules are not absolute, some systems pick 
up messages from all over, regardless of the distribution you've set, so 
don't be surprised if, sooner or later, you get a response to a "local" 
message from several thousand miles away. 
    
Then you can type your message.  If you've composed your message 
offline (generally a good idea if you and emacs don't get along), you 
can upload it now.  You may see a lot of weird looking characters as 
it uploads into emacs, but those will disappear when you hit control-X 
and then control-C.  Alternately: "save" the message (for example, by 
hitting m in rn), log out, compose your message offline, log back on and 
upload your message into a file on your host system.  Then call up 
Usenet, find the article you "saved." Start a reply, and you'll be asked 
if you want to include a prepared message.  Type in the name of the file 
you just created and hit enter.

In rn, you have to wait until you get to the end of a newsgroup to hit F, 
which will bring up a message-composing system.  Alternately, at your 
host system's command line, you can type 
 
     Pnews
 
and hit enter.  You'll be prompted somewhat similarly to the nn 
system, except that you'll be given a list of possible distributions.  
If you chose "world," you'll get this message:
 
                                                                               
 This program posts news to thousands of machines throughout the entire         
 civilized world.  Your message will cost the net hundreds if not thousands of  
 dollars to send everywhere.  Please be sure you know what you are doing.       
                                                                               
 Are you absolutely sure that you want to do this? [ny]                         
 
Don't worry -- your message won't really cost the Net untold amounts, 
although, again, it's a good idea to think for a second whether your 
message really should go everywhere. 
 
If you want to respond to a given post through e-mail, instead of 
publicly, hit R in nn or r or R in rn.  In rn, as with follow-up 
articles, the upper-case key includes the original message in yours. 

Most newsgroups are unmoderated, which means that every message you post 
will eventually wind up on every host system within the geographic region 
you specified that carries that newsgroup. 

Some newsgroups, however, are moderated, as you saw earlier with 
comp.risks.  In these groups, messages are shipped to a single location 
where a moderator, acting much like a magazine editor, decides what 
actually gets posted.  In some cases, groups are moderated like scholarly 
journals.  In other cases, it's to try to cut down on the massive number 
of messages that might otherwise be posted.  


You'll notice that many articles in Usenet end with a fancy "signature" 
that often contains some witty saying, a clever drawing and, almost 
incidentally, the poster's name and e-mail address.  You too can have 
your own "signature" automatically appended to everything you post.  On 
your own computer, create a signature file.  Try to keep it to four lines 
or less, lest you annoy others on the Net.  Then, while 

connected to your host system, at the prompt, type 
 
     cat>.signature
 
and hit enter (note the period before the s).  Upload your signature 
file into this using your communications software's ASCII upload 
protocol.  When done, hit control-D, the Unix command for closing a 
file.  Now, every time you post a message, this will be appended to it. 

There are a few caveats to posting.  Usenet is no different from a Town 
Meeting or publication: you're not supposed to break the law, whether 
that's posting copyrighted material or engaging in illegal activities.  
It is also not a place to try to sell products (except in certain biz. 
and for-sale newsgroups). 


3.8  CROSS-POSTING
 

Sometimes, you'll have an issue you think should be discussed in more 
than one Usenet newsgroup.  Rather than posting individual messages in 
each group, you can post the same message in several groups at once, 
through a process known as cross-posting. 

Say you want to start a discussion about the political ramifications of 
importing rare tropical fish from Brazil.  People who read rec.aquaria 
might have something to say. So might people who read 
alt.politics.animals and talk.politics.misc. 

Cross-posting is easy.  It also should mean that people on other systems 
who subscribe to several newsgroups will see your message only once, 
rather than several times -- news-reading software can cancel out the 
other copies once a person has read the message.  When you get ready to 
post a message (whether through Pnews for rn or the :post command in nn), 
you'll be asked in which newsgroups.  Type the names of the various 
groups, separated by a comma, but no space, for example: 
 
     rec.aquaria,alt.politics.animals,talk.politics.misc
 
and hit enter.  After answering the other questions (geographic 
distribution, etc.), the message will be posted in the various 
groups (unless one of the groups is moderated, in which case the 
message goes to the moderator, who decides whether to make it public). 
     
It's considered bad form to post to an excessive number of newsgroups, or 
inappropriate newsgroups.  Probably, you don't really have to post 
something in 20 different places.  And while you may think your 
particular political issue is vitally important to the fate of the world, 
chances are the readers of rec.arts.comics will not, or at least not 
important enough to impose on them.  You'll get a lot of nasty e-mail 
messages demanding you restrict your messages to the "appropriate" 
newsgroups. 
Chapter 4: USENET II
 
 
4.2  KILLFILES: THE CURE FOR WHAT AILS YOU 

 
As you keep reading Usenet, you are going to run across topics or people 
that really drive you nuts -- or that you just get tired of seeing. 

Killfiles are just the thing for you. When you start your newsreader, it 
checks to see if you have any lists of words, phrases or names you don't 
want to see.  If you do, then it blanks out any messages containing those 
words. 

Such as cascades. 

As you saw earlier, when you post a reply to a message and include parts 
of that message, the original lines show up with a > in front of them.  
Well, what if you reply to a reply?  Then you get a >> in front of the 
line.  And if you reply to that reply? You get >>>.  Keep this up, and 
soon you get a triangle of >'s building up in your message. 

There are people who like building up these triangles, or cascades.  
They'll "respond" to your message by deleting everything you've said, 
leaving only the "In message 123435, you said:" part and the last line of 
your message, to which they add a nonsensical retort.  On and on they go 
until the triangle has reached the right end of the page. Then they try 
to expand the triangle by deleting one > with each new line. Whoever gets 
to finish this mega-triangle wins.        

There is even a newsgroup just for such folks: alt.cascade.  
Unfortunately, cascaders would generally rather cascade in other 
newsgroups. Because it takes a lot of messages to build up a completed 
cascade, the targeted newsgroup soon fills up with these messages. Of 
course, if you complain, you'll be bombarded with messages about the 
First Amendment and artistic expression -- or worse, with another 
cascade. The only thing you can do is ignore them, by setting up a 
killfile. 

There are also certain newsgroups where killfiles will come in handy 
because of the way the newsgroups are organized.  For example, readers of 
rec.arts.tv.soaps always use an acronym in their subject: line for the 
show they're writing about (AMC, for example, for "All My Children").  
This way, people who only want to read about "One Life to Live" can blank 
out all the messages about "The Young and the Restless" and all the 
others (to keep people from accidentally screening out messages that 
might contain the letters "gh" in them, "General Hospital" viewers always 
use "gh:" in their subject lines). 

Both nn and rn let you create killfiles, but in different ways. 

To create a killfile in nn, go into the newsgroup with the offending 
messages and type a capital K.  You'll see this at the bottom of your 
screen: 
 
     AUTO (k)ill or (s)elect (CR => Kill subject 30 days) 
                                                                               
If you hit return, nn will ask you which article's subject you're 
tired of. Chose one and the article and any follow-ups will disappear, 
and you won't see them again for 30 days. 
     
If you type a lower-case k instead, you'll get this: 
 
     AUTO KILL on (s)ubject or (n)ame  (s) 
                                                                               
If you hit your S key or just enter,  you'll see this: 
                                                                               
     KILL Subject: (=/) 
 
Type in the name of the offending word or phrase and hit enter.  You'll 
then be prompted: 
                                                                               
     KILL in (g)roup 'eff.test' or in (a)ll groups  (g) 
                                                                               
except that the name of the group you see will be the one you're actually 
in at the moment.  Because cascaders and other annoying people often 
cross-post their messages to a wide range of newsgroups, you might 
consider hitting a instead of g.  Next comes: 
 
     Lifetime of entry in days (p)ermanent  (30) 
 
The P key will screen out the offending articles forever, while hitting 
enter will do it for 30 days.  You can also type in a number of days for 
the blocking. 

Creating killfiles in rn works differently -- its default killfile 
generator only works for messages in specific groups, rather than 
globally for your entire newsgroup list.  To create a global killfile, 
you'll have to write one yourself. 

To create a killfile in rn, go into the newsgroup where the offending 
messages are and type in its number so you get it on your screen. Type a 
capital K.  From now on, any message with that subject line will 
disappear before you read the group. You should probably choose a reply, 
rather than the original message, so that you will get all of the 
followups (the original message won't have a "Re: " in its subject line). 
The next time you call up that newsgroup, rn will tell you it's killing 
messages. When it's done, hit the space bar to go back into reading mode. 

To create a "global" kill file that will automatically wipe out articles 
in all groups you read, start rn and type control-K.  This will start 
your whatever text editor you have as your default on your host system 
and create a file (called KILL, in your News subdirectory).         

On the first line, you'll type in the word, phrase or name you don't want 
to see, followed by commands that tell rn whether to search an entire 
message for the word or name and then what to do when it finds it. 

Each line must be in this form 
 
     /pattern/modifier:j 
 
"Pattern" is the word or phrase you want rn to look for.  It's caseinsensitive: both "test" and "Test" will be knocked out.  The modifier 
tells rn whether to limit its search to message headers (which can be 
useful when the object is to never see messages from a particular 
person): 
 
     a:    Looks through an entire message 
     h:    Looks just at the header 
    
You can leave out the modifier command, in which case rn will look only 
at the subject line of messages. The "j" at the end tells rn to screen 
out all articles with the offending word. 

So if you never want to see the word "foo" in any header, ever again, 
type this: 
 
     /foo/h:j          
 
This is particularly useful for getting rid of articles from 
people who post in more than one newsgroup, such as cascaders, since 
an article's newsgroup name is always in the header. 

If you just want to block messages with a subject line about cascades, 
you could try: 
  
     /foo/:j 
 
To kill anything that is a followup to any article, use this pattern: 

     /Subject: *Re:/:j 
 
When done writing lines for each phrase to screen, exit the text editor 
as you normally would, and you'll be put back in rn. 
     
One word of caution: go easy on the global killfile.  An extensive global 
killfile, or one that makes frequent use of the a: modifier can 
dramatically slow down rn, since the system will now have to look at 
every single word in every single message in all the newsgroups you want 
to read. 

If there's a particular person whose posts you never want to see again, 
first find his or her address (which will be in the "from:" line of his 
postings) and then write a line in your killfile like this: 
 
     /From: *name@address\.all/h:j


4.4  SOME USENET HINTS

 
Case counts in Unix -- most of the time.  Many Unix commands, including 
many of those used for reading Usenet articles, are case sensitive.  Hit 
a d when you meant a D and either nothing will happen, or something 
completely different from what you expected will happen.  So watch that 
case! 

In nn, you can get help most of the time by typing a question mark (the 
exception is when you are writing your own message, because then you are 
inside the text-processing program).  In rn, type a lower-case h at any 
prompt to get some online help. 

When you're searching for a particular newsgroup, whether through the l 
command in rn or with nngrep for nn, you sometimes may have to try 
several keywords.  For example, there is a newsgroup dedicated to the 
Grateful Dead, but you'd never find it if you tried, say, l grateful 
dead, because the name is rec.music.gdead.  In general, try the smallest 
possible part of the word or discussion you're looking for, for example, 
use "trek" to find newsgroups about "Star Trek."  If one word doesn't 
produce anything, try another. 


4.5 THE BRAIN-TUMOR BOY, THE MODEM TAX AND THE FCC     

Like the rest of the world, Usenet has its share of urban legends and 
questionable activities.  There are three in particular that plague the 
network.  Spend more than, oh, 15 minutes within Usenet and you're sure 
to run into the Brain Tumor Boy, the plot by the evil FCC to tax your 
modem and Dave Rhode's miracle cure for poverty.  For the record, here's 
the story on all of them: 

There once was a seven-year-old boy in England named Craig Shergold who 
was diagnosed with a seemingly incurable brain tumor.  As he lay dying, 
he wished only to have friends send him postcards.  The local newspapers 
got a hold of the tear-jerking story.  Soon, the boy's wish had changed: 
he now wanted to get into the Guinness Book of World Records for the 
largest postcard collection.  Word spread around the world. People by the 
millions sent him postcards. 

Miraculously, the boy lived.  An American billionaire even flew him to 
the U.S. for surgery to remove what remained of the tumor.  And his wish 
succeeded beyond his wildest dreams -- he made the Guinness Book of World 
Records. 

But with Craig now well into his teens, his dream has turned into a 
nightmare for the post office in the small town outside London where he 
lives.  Like Craig himself, his request for cards just refuses to die, 
inundating the post office with millions of cards every year.  Just when 
it seems like the flow is slowing, along comes somebody else who starts 
up a whole new slew of requests for people to send Craig post cards (or 
greeting cards or business cards -- Craig letters have truly taken on a 
life of their own and begun to mutate). Even Dear Abby has been powerless 
to make it stop! 

What does any of this have to do with the Net? The Craig letter seems to 
pop up on Usenet as often as it does on cork boards at major 
corporations.  No matter how many times somebody like Gene Spafford posts 
periodic messages to ignore them or spend your money on something more 
sensible (a donation to the local Red Cross, say), somebody manages to 
post a letter asking readers to send cards to poor little Craig. 

Don't send any cards to the Federal Communications Commission, either. 

In 1987, the FCC considered removing a tax break it had granted 
CompuServe and other large commercial computer networks for use of the 
national phone system.  The FCC quickly reconsidered after alarmed users 
of bulletin-board systems bombarded it with complaints about this "modem 
tax." 

Now, every couple of months, somebody posts an "urgent" message warning 
Net users that the FCC is about to impose a modem tax.  This is NOT true.  
The way you can tell if you're dealing with the hoax story is simple: it 
ALWAYS mentions an incident in which a talk-show host on KGO radio in San 
Francisco becomes outraged on the air when he reads a story about the tax 
in the New York Times.  

Another way to tell it's not true is that it never mentions a specific 
FCC docket number or closing date for comments. 

Save that letter to your congressman for something else. 

Sooner or later, you're going to run into a message titled "Make Money 
Fast."  It's your basic chain letter.  The Usenet version is always about 
some guy named Dave Rhodes who was on the verge of death, or something, 
when he discovered a perfectly legal way to make tons of money -- by 
posting a chain letter on computer systems around the world. Yeah, right. 


4.7  THE FIRST AMENDMENT AS LOCAL ORDINANCE
 
 
Usenet's international reach raises interesting legal questions that have 
yet to be fully resolved.  Can a discussion or posting that is legal in 
one country be transmitted to a country where it is against the law?  
Does the posting even become illegal when it reaches the border?  And 
what if that country is the only path to a third country where the 
message is legal as well?  Several foreign colleges and other 
institutions have cut off feeds of certain newsgroups where Americans 
post what is, in the U.S., perfectly legal discussions of drugs or 
alternative sexual practices.  Even in the U.S., some universities have 
discontinued certain newsgroups their administrators find offensive, 
again, usually in the alt. hierarchy. 

An interesting example of this sort of question happened in 1993, when a 
Canadian court issued a gag order on Canadian reporters covering a 
particularly controversial murder case.  Americans, not bound by the gag 
order, began posting accounts of the trial -- which any Canadian with a 
Net account could promptly read. 


4.8  USENET HISTORY  
 

In the late 1970s, Unix developers came up with a new feature: a system 
to allow Unix computers to exchange data over phone lines. 

In 1979, two graduate students at Duke University in North Carolina, Tom 
Truscott and Jim Ellis, came up with the idea of using this system, known 
as UUCP (for Unix-to-Unix CoPy), to distribute information of interest to 
people in the Unix community.  Along with Steve Bellovin, a graduate 
student at the University of North Carolina and Steve Daniel, they wrote 
conferencing software and linked together computers at Duke and UNC. 
 
Word quickly spread and by 1981, a graduate student at Berkeley, Mark 
Horton and a nearby high school student, Matt Glickman, had released a 
new version that added more features and was able to handle larger 
volumes of postings -- the original North Carolina program was meant for 
only a few articles in a newsgroup each day. 

Today, this system, now called Usenet, connects tens of thousands of 
sites around the world, from mainframes to Amigas.  With more than 3,000 
newsgroups and untold thousands of readers, it is perhaps the world's 
largest computer network. 

            
4.10 FYI


Leanne Phillips periodically posts a list of frequently asked questions 
(and answers) about use of the rn killfile function in the 
news.newusers.questions and news.answers newsgroups on Usenet.  Bill 
Wohler posts a guide to using the nn newsreader in the news.answers and 
news.software newsgroups.  Look in the news.announce.newusers and 
news.groups newsgroups on Usenet for "A Guide to Social Newsgroups and 
Mailing Lists,'' which gives brief summaries of the various soc. 
newsgroups. 

"Managing UUCP and Usenet,' by Tim O'Reilly and Grace Todino (O'Reilly & 
Associates, 1992) is a good guide for setting up your own Usenet system.

5.2 BITNET
    
 
As if Usenet and mailing lists were not enough, there are Bitnet 
"discussion groups" or "lists."  

Bitnet is an international network linking colleges and universities, but 
it uses a different set of technical protocols for distributing 
information from the Internet or Usenet. It offers hundreds of discussion 
groups, comparable in scope to Usenet newsgroups.  As with Internet 
mailing lists, Bitnet discussions take place in e-mail. However, where 
mailing lists are often maintained by a person, all Bitnet discussion 
groups are automated -- you subscribe to them through messages to a 
"listserver" computer.  This is a kind of robot moderator that controls 
distribution of messages on the list.  In many cases, it also maintains 
indexes and archives of past postings in a given discussion group, which 
can be handy if you want to get up to speed with a discussion or just 
search for some information related to it. 

Many Bitnet discussion groups are now "translated" into Usenet form and 
carried through Usenet in the bit.listserv hierarchy.  In general, it's 
probably better to read messages through Usenet if you can.  It saves 
some storage space on your host system's hard drives as well as reducing 
clutter in your mailbox. Think of opening your e-mailbox one day to find 
200 messages in it -- 199 of them from a discussion group and one of them 
a "real" e-mail message that's important to you. 

Subscribing and canceling subscriptions is done through an e-mail message 
to the listserver computer.  For addressing, all listservers are known as 
"listserv" (yep) at some Bitnet address.  This means you will have to add 
".bitnet" to the end of the address, if it's in a form like this: 
listserv@miamiu. For example, if you have an interest in environmental 
issues, you might want to subscribe to the Econet discussion group.  To 
subscribe, send an e-mail message to 
 
     listserv@miamiu.bitnet
 
Some Bitnet listservers are also connected to the Internet, so if you 
see a listserver address ending in ".edu", you can e-mail the 
listserver without adding ".bitnet" to the end. 

Always leave the "subject:" line blank in a message to a listserver.  
Inside the message, you tell the listserver what you want, with a series 
of simple commands: 
 
subscribe group Your Name    To subscribe to a list, where "group"
                             is the list name and "Your Name" is 
                             your full name, for example:
                             subscribe econet Henry Fielding
 
unsubscribe group Your Name  To discontinue a group, for example:
                             unsubscribe econet Henry Fielding
 
list global                  This sends you a list of all available 
                             Bitnet discussion groups.  But be careful 
                             -- the list is VERY long! 
 
get refcard                  Sends you a list of other commands you 
                             can use with a listserver, such as 
                             commands for retrieving past postings 
                             from a discussion group. 
 
Each of these commands goes on a separate line in your message (and you 
can use one or all of them).  If you want to get a list of all Bitnet 
discussion groups, send e-mail to 
 
     listserv@bitnic.educom.edu
 
Leave the "subject:" line blank and use the list global command.
     
When you subscribe to a Bitnet group, there are two important differences 
from Usenet. 

First, when you want to post a message for others to read in the 
discussion group, you send a message to the group name at its Bitnet 
address.  Using Econet as an example, you would mail the message to: 
 
     econet@miamiu.bitnet
 
Note that this is different from the listserv address you used to 
subscribe to the group to begin with.  Use the listserv address ONLY to 
subscribe to or unsubscribe from a discussion group.  If you use the 
discussion-group address to try to subscribe or unsubscribe, your message 
will go out to every other subscriber, many of whom will think unkind 
thoughts, which they may share with you in an e-mail message). 

The second difference relates to sending an e-mail message to the author 
of a particular posting.  Usenet newsreaders such as rn and nn let you do 
this with one key.  But if you hit your R key to respond to a discussiongroup message, your message will go to the listserver, and from there to 
everybody else on the list!  This can prove embarrassing to you and 
annoying to others. To make sure your message goes just to the person who 
wrote the posting, take down his e-mail address from the posting and then 
compose a brand-new message. Remember, also, that if you see an e-mail 
address like IZZY@INDYVMS, it's a Bitnet address. 

Two Bitnet lists will prove helpful for delving further into the network.  
NEW-LIST tells you the names of new discussion groups. To subscribe, send 
a message to listserv@ndsuvm1.bitnet: 
 
     sub NEW-LIST Your Name
 
INFONETS is the place to go when you have questions about Bitnet.  It is 
also  first rate for help on questions about all major computer networks 
and how to reach them.  To subscribe, send e-mail to 
info-nets-request@think.com: 
 
     sub INFONETS Your Name
 
Both of these lists are also available on Usenet, the former as 
bit.listserv.new-list; the latter as bit.listserv.infonets (sometimes 
bit.listserv.info-nets). 





 
 
6.2  LIBRARY CATALOGS
     

Several hundred libraries around the world, from the Snohomish Public 
Library in Washington State to the Library of Congress are now available 
to you through telnet. You can use Hytelnet to find their names, telnet 
addresses and use instructions. 

Why would you want to browse a library you can't physically get to?  Many 
libraries share books, so if yours doesn't have what you're looking for, 
you can tell the librarian where he or she can get it.  Or if you live in 
an area where the libraries are not yet online, you can use telnet to do 
some basic bibliographic research before you head down to the local 
branch. 

There are several different database programs in use by online libraries.  
Harvard's is one of the easier ones to use, so let's try it. 

Telnet to hollis.harvard.edu.  
                                                                               
     To select one of the applications above, type its name on the command     
     line followed by your user ID, and press RETURN.                          
                    ** HOLLIS DOES NOT REQUIRE A USERID **                     
                                                                               
     EXAMPLES:   HOLLIS (press RETURN)  or  HUBS userid (press RETURN)         
 
Type
 
              hollis
 
and hit enter.  You'll see several screens flash by quickly until finally 
the system stops and you'll get this: 
 
                          WELCOME TO HOLLIS                                    
              (Harvard OnLine Library Information System)                      
                                                                               
 To begin, type one of the 2-character database codes listed below:            
                                                                               
        HU      Union Catalog of the Harvard libraries                         
        OW      Catalog of Older Widener materials                             
 
The first thing to notice is the name of the system: Hollis. Librarians 
around the world seem to be inordinately found of cutesy, 
anthropomorphized acronyms for their machines (not far from Harvard, the 
librarians at Brandeis University came up with Library On-Line User 
Information Service, or Louis; MIT has Barton). 

If you want to do some general browsing, probably the best bet on the 
Harvard system is to chose HU, which gets you access to their main 
holdings, including those of its medical libraries.  Chose that, and 
you'll see this: 
                          
              THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY UNION CATALOG                     
                                                                               
 
Say you want to see if Harvard has shed the starchy legacy of the 
Puritans, who founded the school.  Why not see if they have "The Joy of 
Sex" somewhere in their stacks? Type 
 
               TI Joy of Sex
 
and hit enter. This comes up:
 

 
Oh, well!  Do they have anything that mentions "sex" in the title?  Try 
another TI search, but this time just: TI sex.  You get:
 
 
If you want to get more information on the first line, type 1 and hit enter.
 
 
Most library systems give you a way to log off and return to your host 
system.  On Hollis, hit escape followed by 
 
          xx
 
One particularly interesting system is the one run by the Colorado 
Alliance of Research Libraries, which maintains databases for libraries 
throughout Colorado, the West and even in Boston. 

     Telnet pac.carl.org.

Follow the simple log-in instructions. When you get a menu, type 72 (even 
though that is not listed), which takes you to the Pikes Peak Library 
District, which serves the city of Colorado Springs. 

Several years ago, its librarians realized they could use their database 
program not just for books but for cataloging city records and community 
information, as well.  Today, if you want to look up municipal ordinances 
or city records, you only have to type in the word you're looking for and 
you'll get back cites of the relevant laws or decisions. 

Carl will also connect you to the University of Hawaii library, which, 
like the one in Colorado Springs, has more than just bibliographic 
material online.  One of its features is an online Hawaiian almanac that 
can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about Hawaiians, 
including the number injured in boogie-board accidents each year (seven). 


6.4  TELNET BULLETIN-BOARD SYSTEMS
 
You might think that Usenet, with its hundreds of newsgroups, would be 
enough to satisfy the most dedicated of online communicators. 

But there are a number of "bulletin-board" and other systems that provide 
even more conferences or other services, many not found directly on the 
Net.  Some are free; others charge for access.  
 
To be able to write messages and gain access to files, you have to leave 
a note to SYSOP with your name, address, occupation and phone number.  To 
do this, at any prompt, hit your M key and then enter, which will bring 
up the mail system. 

Hitting H brings up a list of commands and how to use 
them. 

Telnet: bugs.mty.itesm.mx (8 p.m. to 10 a.m., Eastern time, only).
At the "login:" prompt, type
 
bbs
 
and hit enter.
 
Cleveland Free-Net.  The first of a series of Free-Nets, this represents 
an ambitious attempt to bring the Net to the public. Originally an inhospital help network, it is now sponsored by Case Western Reserve 
University, the city of Cleveland, the state of Ohio and IBM. It uses 
simple menus, similar to those found on CompuServe, but organized like a 
city. 
 
 
The system has a vast and growing collection of public documents, from 
copies of U.S. and Ohio Supreme Court decisions to the Magna Carta and 
the U.S. Constitution.  It links residents to various government agencies 
and has daily stories from USA Today. Beyond Usenet (found in the 
Teleport area), it has a large collection of local conferences on 
everything from pets to politics.  And yes, it's free! 

 
When you connect to Free-Net, you can look around the system.  However, 
if you want to be able to post messages hn its conferences or use e-mail, 
you will have to apply in writing for an account.  Information on this is 
available when you connect. 
                                    
 
DUBBS.  This is a bulletin-board system in Delgt in the Nether}ands. The 
conferences and files are mostly in Dutch, but the help files and the 
system commands themselves are in English. 
 
ISCA BBS.  Run by the Iowa Student Computer Association, it has more than 
100 conferences, including several in foreign languages.  After you 
register, hit K for a list of available conferences and then J to join a 
particular conference (you have to type in the name of the conference, 
not the number next to it).  Hitting H brings up information about 
commands. 
 
Youngstown Free-Net.  The people who created Cleveland Free-Net sell 
their software for $1 to anybody willing to set up a similar system. A 
number of cities now have their own Free-Nets, including Youngstown, 
Ohio. 
 

6.5  PUTTING THE FINGER ON SOMEONE
 
Finger is a handy little program which lets you find out more about 
people on the Net -- and lets you tell others on the Net more about 
yourself. 

Finger uses the same concept as telnet or ftp. But it works with only one 
file, called .plan (yes, with a period in front).  This is a text file an 
Internet user creates with a text editor in his home directory.  You can 
put your phone number in there, tell a little bit about yourself, or 
write almost anything at all. 

To finger somebody else's .plan file, type this at the command line: 
 
     finger email-address
 
where email-address is the person's e-mail address.  If that person's 
site allows incoming finger requests (not all do), You'll get back a 
display that shows the last time the person was online, whether 
they've gotten any new mail since that time and what, if anything, is 
in their .plan file.

Some people and institutions have come up with creative uses for these 
.plan files, letting you do everything from checking the weather in 
Massachusetts to getting the latest baseball standings.  Try fingering 
these e-mail addresses: 
 
weather@cirrus.mit.edu            Latest National Weather Service weather 
                                  forecasts for regions in Massachusetts.
 
quake@geophys.washington.edu      Locations and magnitudes of recent 
                                  earthquakes around the world. 
 
jtchern@ocf.berkeley.edu          Current major-league baseball standings and 
                                  results of the previous day's games.
 
nasanews@space.mit.edu            The day's events at NASA.
 
coke@cs.cmu.edu                   See how many cans of each type of soda
                                  are left in a particular soda machine
                                  in the computer-science department of
                                  Carnegie-Mellon University.


6.6  FINDING SOMEONE ON THE NET
 

So you have a friend and you want to find out if he has an Internet 
account to which you can write?  The quickest way may be to just pick up 
the phone, call him and ask him.  Although there are a variety of "white 
pages" services available on the Internet, they are far from complete -- 
college students, users of commercial services such as CompuServe and 
many Internet public-access sites, and many others simply won't be 
listed.  Major e-mail providers are working on a universal directory 
system, but that could be some time away. 

In the meantime, a couple of "white pages" services might give you some 
leads, or even just entertain you as you look up famous people or longlost acquaintances. 

The whois directory provides names, e-mail and postal mail address and 
often phone numbers for people listed in it.  To use it, telnet to 
 
     internic.net
 
No log-on is needed.  The quickest way to use it is to type
 
     whois name
 
at the prompt, where "name" is the last name or organization name you're 
looking for.  If there's a match, you'll get back an e-mail listing.

Another service worth trying, especially since it seems to give beginners 
fewer problems, is the Knowbot Information Service reachable by telnet at 
 
     info.cnri.reston.va.us 185

Again, no log-on is needed.  This service actually searches through a 
variety of other "white pages" systems, including the user directory for 
MCIMail.  To look for somebody, type
 
     query name
 
where "name" is the last name of the person you're looking for.  You can 
get details of other commands by hitting a question mark at the prompt. 
You can also use the knowbot system by e-mail.  Start a message to

     netaddress@info.cnri.reston.va.us
 
You can leave the "subject:" line blank. As your message, type

     query name

for the simplest type of search.  If you want details on more complex
searches, add another line:
 
     man

Another way to search is via the Usenet name server. This is a system at 
MIT that keeps track of the e-mail addresses of everybody who posts a 
Usenet message that appears at MIT. It works by e-mail.  Send a message 
to 
     
          mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu

Leave the "subject:" line blank. As your message, write 

           send usenet-addresses/lastname

where "lastname" is the last name of the person you're looking for. The 
system will write back with any matches and the associated addresses.
 

6.8  FYI
 
The Usenet newsgroups alt.internet.services and alt.bbs.internet can 
provide pointers to new telnet systems.  Scott Yanoff periodically 
posts his "Updated Internet Services List" in the former. The 
alt.bbs.internet newsgroup is also where you'll find Aydin Edguer's 
compendium of FAQs related to Internet bulletin-board systems.                 

Peter Scott, who maintains the Hytelnet database, runs a mailing list

Liberal use of archie will help you find specific files or documents.  
For information on new or interesting ftp sites, try the comp.archives 
newsgroup on Usenet.  You can also look in the comp.misc, 
comp.sources.wanted or news.answers newsgroups on Usenet for lists of ftp 
sites posted every month by Tom Czarnik and Jon Granrose. 
 
The comp.archives newsgroup carries news of new ftp sites and interesting 
new files on existing sites.                                   

In the comp.virus newsgroup on Usenet, look for postings that list ftp 
sites carrying anti-viral software for Amiga, MS-DOS, Macintosh, Atari 
and other computers. 

The comp.sys.ibm.pc.digest and comp.sys.mac.digest newsgroups provide 
information about new MS-DOS and Macintosh programs as well as answers to 
questions from users of those computers. 





7.2  YOUR FRIEND ARCHIE


How do you find a file you want, though?

Until a few years ago, this could be quite the pain -- there was no 
master directory to tell you where a given file might be stored on the 
Net. Who'd want to slog through hundreds of file libraries looking for 
something? 

Alan Emtage, Bill Heelan and Peter Deutsch, students at McGill University 
in Montreal, asked the same question.  Unlike the weather, though, they 
did something about it. 

They created a database system, called archie, that would periodically 
call up file libraries and basically find out what they had available.  
In turn, anybody could dial into archie, type in a file name, and see 
where on the Net it was available. Archie currently catalogs some 1,000 
file libraries around the world. 

Today, there are three ways to ask archie to find a file for you: through 
telnet, "client" Archie program on your own host system or e-mail.  All 
three methods let you type in a full or partial file name and will tell 
you where on the Net it's stored. 

If you have access to telnet, you can telnet to one of the following 
addresses: archie.mcgill.ca; archie.sura.net; archie.unl.edu; 
archie.ans.net; or archie.rutgers.edu.  If asked for a log-in name, type 
 
     archie
 
and hit enter.
     
When you connect, the key command is prog, which you use in this form: 
 
     prog filename
 
Followed by enter, where "filename" is the program or file you're looking 
for. If you're unsure of a file's complete name, try typing in part of 
the name. For example, "PKZIP" will work as well as "PKZIP204.EXE."  The 
system does not support DOS or Unix wildcards.  If you ask archie to look 
for "PKZIP*," it will tell you it couldn't find anything by that name.  
One thing to keep in mind is that a file is not necessarily the same as a 
program -- it could also be a document.  This means you can use archie to 
search for, say, everything online related to the Beetles, as well as 
computer programs and graphics files. 

A number of Net sites now have their own archie programs that take your 
request for information and pass it onto the nearest archie database -- 
ask your system administrator if she has it online. These "client" 
programs seem to provide information a lot more quickly than the actual 
archie itself!  If it is available, at your host system's command line, 
type 
 
     archie -s filename
 
where filename is the program or document you're looking for, and hit 
enter.  The -s tells the program to ignore case in a file name and lets 
you search for partial matches. You might actually want to type it this 
way: 
 
     archie -s filename|more
 
which will stop the output every screen (handy if there are many sites 
that carry the file you want).  Or you could open a file on your computer 
with your text-logging function. 

The third way, for people without access to either of the above, is email. Send a message to archie@quiche.cs.mcgill.ca. You can leave the 
subject line blank.  Inside the message, type 
 
     prog filename
 
where filename is the file you're looking for.  You can ask archie to 
look up several programs by putting their names on the same "prog" line, 
like this:
                       
     prog file1 file2 file3
      
Within a few hours, archie will write back with a list of the appropriate 
sites. 

In all three cases, if there is a system that has your file, you'll get a 
response that looks something like this: 
 
   Host sumex-aim.stanford.edu
 
     Location: /info-mac/comm
            FILE -rw-r--r--     258256  Feb 15 17:07  zterm-09.hqx
     Location: /info-mac/misc
            FILE -rw-r--r--       7490  Sep 12 1991  zterm-sys7-color-icons.hqx
 
Chances are, you will get a number of similar looking responses for each 
program.  The "host" is the system that has the file.  The "Location" 
tells you which directory to look in when you connect to that system.  
Ignore the funny-looking collections of r's and hyphens for now.  After 
them, come the size of the file or directory listing in bytes, the date 
it was uploaded, and the name of the file.
