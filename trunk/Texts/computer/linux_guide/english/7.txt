3.3.5 Moving files

 
      A new command named mv moves files, instead of copying them. The syntax is very straightforward. 

Notice how termcap no longer exists, but in its place is the file sells. This can be used to rename files, as we have just done, but also to move a file to a completely new directory. 

Note: mv and cp will overwrite the destination file (if it already exists) without asking you. Be careful when you move a file into another directory: there may already be a file with the same name in that directory, which you'll overwrite!
