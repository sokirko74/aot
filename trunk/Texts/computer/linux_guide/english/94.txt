Note that in the example ``screens'' printed below I'm only showing the most important information, and what you see may differ. Also, commands in italics represent commands that you type; everything else is screen output. 

To start ftp and connect to a site, simply use the command 

ftp 

where is the name of the site you are connecting to. For example, to connect to the mythical site shoop.vpizza.com we can use the command 

ftp shoop.vpizza.com
