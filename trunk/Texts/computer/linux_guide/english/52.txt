         You can create a filesystem on a floppy just as you would on a hard drive partition. For example, 

# mke2fs /dev/fd0 1440 

creates a filesystem on the floppy in /dev/fd0. The size of the filesystem must correspond to the size of the floppy. High-density 3.5" disks are 1.44 megabytes, or 1440 blocks, in size. High-density 5.25" disks are 1200 blocks. 

  In order to access the floppy, you must mount the filesystem contained on it. The command 

# mount -t ext2 /dev/fd0 /mnt 

will mount the floppy in /dev/fd0 on the directory /mnt. Now, all of the files on the floppy will appear under /mnt on your drive. The ``-t ext2'' specifies an ext2fs filesystem type. If you created another type of filesystem on the floppy, you'll need to specify its type to the mount command. 

  The ``mount point'' (the directory where you're mounting the filesystem) needs to exist when you use the mount command. If it doesn't exist, simply create it with mkdir. 

See Section 4.8 for more information on filesystems, mounting, and mount points. 

    Note that any I/O to the floppy is buffered just as hard disk I/O is. If you change data on the floppy, you may not see the drive light come on until the kernel flushes its I/O buffers. It's important that you not remove a floppy before you unmount it; this can be done with the command 

# umount /dev/fd0 

Do not simply switch floppies as you would on an MS-DOS system; whenever you change floppies, umount the first one and mount the next.
