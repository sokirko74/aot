Mosenergo 1H 1999 Results
Mosenergo released 1H 1999 financial results, which were somewhat better then we 
had expected as the company has managed to keep operating costs unchanged while 
raising sales (in ruble terms). However, we think that this performance is 
unsustainable as most cost items are rising and the scope for future sales 
growth is limited. Also, good 1H 1999 figures were significantly influenced by 
special discounts on gas, which saved the company Rb 137 million ($5.7 million). 
We have adjusted our full-year 1999 forecast for Mosenergo in light of the 
actual 1H 1999 results. We now expect that the company will generate $125 
million operating profit and $63 million adjusted net profit on sales of $920 
million. This corresponds with P/Sales'99 of 0.95 and P/EBIT'99 of 6.96. We 
maintain our "Hold" rating on the stock due to high relative valuation multiples 
and poor short-term growth prospects. 
Sales fell by 74% Y-o-Y in dollar terms to $480 million, and rose 4% in ruble 
terms to Rb 11.6 billion. The improved ruble sales were due to increases of 6.6% 
in average electricity tariffs and 20% in average heating tariffs since the 
beginning of 1999. 
The volume of electricity sales fell by 1.3% to 25.2 billion kWh, reflecting the 
company's strategy of reducing sales to the national grid. However, electricity 
generation grew by 0.1%, demonstrating falling efficiency of electricity 
transmission. The volume of heat sales also fell by 4.9% to 38.6 million Gcal 
due to relatively warm weather conditions. 
Operating Expenses fell by 75% in dollar terms to $323 million and by 1% in 
ruble terms to Rb 7.8 billion. This was purely the result of Rb 137 million 
savings on gas purchases. Under an agreement with the Moscow government and 
Mosenergo, Gazprom offered a 27% discount on the price of gas used to generate 
power for social customers (hospitals, schools, etc.), which together comprise 
about 25% of the company's output. We do not know how long this agreement is 
supposed to stay in force and its cancellation at any time would deprive 
Mosenergo of its main current advantage. 
Other cost items grew, reflecting inflation. The cost of coal and oil, 
comprising 10% of Mosenergo's fuel mix, grew by about 20%, labor costs jumped by 
35% and costs of maintenance and repair work grew by 20%. Costs were also 
affected by an increase in relative costs per unit of power output as fixed 
costs remain stable when power sales fall. Transmission losses grew by Rb 93 
million ($3.8 million). 
Profits. Higher sales and stable costs resulted in a 12% increase in operating 
profit in ruble terms and an improvement in the operating margin from 19% to 20% 
Y-o-Y. 
The bottom line was hit by currency translation loss from $208 million long-term 
debts. Thus, profit before tax fell by 4% in rubles to Rb 1.8 billion and the 
pre-tax margin fell from 17% to 16%. However, excluding the currency translation 
effect, Mosenergo would show net profit of Rb 2.1 billion ($85 million), 
representing a 39% increase in ruble terms. 
Payment collection was quite impressive at 93.5% of charged bills in 1H 99 
compared to 80% in 1H 98. The collection rate soared to 111% in 2Q 99. The cash 
component in overall payments fell from 59% last year to 51% in 1999 as a result 
of the financial crisis last fall. 
As of July 1, 1999 accounts receivable were $621 million, down 11% in dollar 
terms since the beginning of the year but up 5% in ruble terms. At the same time 
improved payment collection allowed Mosenergo to reduce its payables by 3.4% in 
rubles to Rb 9.15 billion ($377 million).
