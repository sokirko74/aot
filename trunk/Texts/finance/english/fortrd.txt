FOREIGN TRADE
The situation in international markets for main items of the Russian export is 
still unstable, though it has improved slightly since March 1999.
In the meantime world prices for oil and petroleum derivatives are lower when 
compared with average prices in November 1997 when they began to fall sharply. 
With offer significantly exceeding demand and a low growth rate of the leading 
oil- consuming countries' economies, prospects of the respective market will 
remain unfavorable for oil suppliers.
An average contract price for the Russian oil in 1998 made up USD 10.4/barrel, 
and as of February 1, 1999, that for Urals- USD 9.46/barrel. Upon OPEC 
countries' signing the agreement on reducing the overall volume of oil 
extraction to 1.7 bln. barrels daily by the end of the year ( and to 2 bln. 
barrels with the account of other countries, including Russia), the price for 
Urals reached USD 13/ barrel.
The demand for natural gas in international market has fallen recently , and the 
competition among gas exporters intensifies. Thus in 1998 the price for natural 
gas supplied to Germany dropped by 15% compared with 1997 (to USD 80 per thous. 
cubic m.). In the Ist quarter 1999, the price for the Russian gas supplied to 
East - and Central - European countries made up a.. USD 59.3 per thous. cubic m. 
It is black oil and diesel fuel which are main items of the Russian export of 
petroleum derivatives (85%). In march 1999 the price for 1 t. of black oil in 
Europe made up USD 62 which is at USD 13 - 15 ( 12%) down compared with early 
1998. In early 1998 the price for diesel fuel was USD 158 /t., while in March 
1999- USD127/t/ (13% down).
The trend to a fall in export price for ferrous metals continues. With anti- 
dumping measures being implemented against the Russian producers in the US, the 
economic situation in the Russian domestic market has complicated. Metallurgical 
enterprises provide a. 10% of revenues to budgets of all levels and over 20% of 
the overall volume of hard currency revenues. In the meantime, with the account 
of anti- dumping procedures against the export of the Russian steel undertaken 
by a number of countries, the volume of revenues in foreign exchange will fall 
followed by reduction in the budgetary revenues. The anti- dumping investigation 
held in the US provoked other countries' reaction. In the wake of the measures 
undertaken by US, Mexico, India, Turkey, China, Indonesia, Canada, Argentina, 
Brazil, Philippines, Columbia, Taiwan, South African Republic, and Venezuela 
initiated introduction of quotas of the export of the Russian ferrous 
metallurgy's products.
In the Ist quarter 1999, an average contract price for aluminum supplied to Far 
Abroad states would drop to the level of 1994 ( USD 1,121/t.), and prices for 
nickel and copper are still low ( USD 3,835/t. and 1,445/t., respectively). The 
trend to the lowering of prices may remain in 1999.
In the Ist quarter 1999 the Russian foreign trade turnover made up USD 25.0 
bln., including export ( import) operations which are not registered. That is at 
32.1% down compared with the respective period of 1998. However, while compared 
with February this year, one notes a significant growth - at 22.7%.

The value volume of the Russian export dropped by 10.6% relative to the Ist 
quarter 1998 and made up USD 15.6 bln., including that to Far- Abroad countries- 
12.7 bln. ( 8% down). The share of Far- Abroad countries in the total volume of 
the Russian export made up 85%.
The Rb. depreciation encourages exporters to increase the physical volume of 
their supplies. The price index by the items making up a. 70% of the export 
value was 0.72, while the physical volume index reached 1.03.
The Rb. depreciation after August 1998 has had a positive impact on the non- 
ferrous metallurgy: with the export prices for aluminum and copper falling, the 
volume of export of those grows. Thus, in March 1999 the respective export 
supplies grew by 4.4% relative to March 1998, and by 10.5% when compared with 
July 1998.
The wood- working and paper and pulp industry branches which are partly oriented 
towards exports experience a notable growth in output. During the first months 
1999, the volume of exportation of cellulose, timber and lumber grew 
significantly compared with its respective level of 1998. That may be attributed 
to lower costs and high international prices for these products compared with 
the domestic prices.
Despite low prices for the fuel and energy sector's products, in March 1999 the 
export of those remained almost on the same level as of March 1998 
In the Ist quarter 1999, the proportional weight of machinery, equipment and 
means of transportation in the overall volume of export made up 8.8%, including 
the export to Far- Abroad countries- 9% ( in 1998- 9.3%).
In March 1999 export supplies grew by 25.7% compared with February, including a. 
30.8% growth in supplies to Far - Abroad states.
Between January to March, the value of import supplies made up USD 9.4 bln.- a 
48.9% fall compared with its respective period of the prior year, including 
supplies from far- Abroad countries totaled USD 7.3 bln. (47.5% down).
Relative to February 1998, in March import supplies from Far - Abroad countries 
grew by 5.6% and made up USD 2.7 bln. Import purchases of food stuffs grew by 
28%, chemicals- by 22.9%, including pharmaceutical items - by 18.7%. At the same 
time purchases of textile garments and shoes practically remained unchanged, 
while supplies of machinery and technological equipment continued to fall: the 
import those dropped by 31.3% compared with February.
Contrast to the aforementioned trends in Russia's trade with the Western 
countries despite positive monthly dynamics in the Ist quarter, this year the 
trade with the CIS states make up only 60- 65% of the last year's level. in 
terms of the export/ import volume.
In May 1999, the government of Belarus made a decision to elaborate a new 
concept of monetary and credit policy aimed at achieving the Belorussian Rb. 
convertibility by current operations and stability of its exchange rate. At the 
same time the concept does not provide for a single Russian- Belorussian 
currency, and the authors of that will not orient themselves to the Russian 
model. Hence, the uncertainty and lack of coordination with Russia with regard 
to the future Belorussian national monetary and credit policy may create new 
obstacles in the trade between the two states and entail a fall in its
volume, regardless of the Customs Union with its beneficial conditions for 
mutual trade.
This year, battered by the Russian crisis, the Customs Union clearly looses its 
efficiency. Thus, Kyrgystan is increasingly orient itself towards Far - Abroad 
countries and significantly (by a. 55%) reduced its trade with Russia. In 
addition to that, Kyrgystan stopped to coordinate its domestic anti-crisis 
economic policy with the partners in the Customs Union.
Foreign trade regulation.
In compliance with the CBR's instruction of March 20, 1999, effective since 
March 22, 1999, which regulate residents' purchases of foreign exchange to 
perform their obligations as per import contracts, while effecting advanced 
payments in foreign exchange by import contracts, the importer is bound to place 
a deposit with his bank in Rb. equivalent amounted to a full value of the said 
advanced payment using the CBR exchange rate as of the day of purchase the 
foreign currency. The deposit is returned upon confirmation of importation of 
the goods in Russia.
This measure is undertaken against capital outflow from this country under false 
import contracts. According to CBR's estimates, the amount of capital outflow 
through that channel totals to USD 0.5 bln. a mohth.
Since April 22, the export duty on crude oil of Euro 2.5/t. is renewed. 
Previously, since March 23, 1999, in compliance with the government's decision, 
the oil export duty was canceled for the term of 1 month, since an average 
monthly oil price in February was under USD 9.8/barrel, while in March the 
average price was in the range between USD 9.8- 12.3/barrel. Therefore since 
April 22, the oil export duty will be renewed automatically.
Since April 1, Russia has reduced its export oil supplies by 100,000 barrels a 
day. The decision was made in order to support the OPEC countries' proposal on 
reducing the world oil extraction. It is envisaged that since April 1, the 
volume of oil extraction would be reduced by 18% until March 2000.
