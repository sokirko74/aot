The monetary strategy of the Bank of Russia in 1999 is to contain 
inflation, taking into account GDP dynamics trends, the unemployment 
rate and the state of the balance of payments, and gradually to 
embark on the path of economic growth. The main conditions of the 
successful implementation of this strategy are the rehabilitation of 
the banking system, restoration of the financial markets, foreign 
debt settlement and the creation of a mechanism to ensure 
unconditional fulfilment of debt obligations in all forms.
The Bank of Russia believes that in 1999 it must ensure that GDP 
dynamics corresponds to the money supply (M2) in order to prevent an 
inflationary overheating of the economy. The intermediate objective 
of the Bank of Russia’s monetary policy in 1999 is to maintain M2 
growth rates at within the bands of 18-26%.
Owing to the underdevelopment of financial markets, which have 
changed for the worse under the impact of the financial crisis, it 
is now impossible to use interest rate indicators as intermediate 
targets of the monetary policy. The state of the balance of payments 
in 1998-1999 and the present level of international reserves do not 
permit the use of the exchange rate, that is fixing it in one way or 
another, for these purposes. 
To readjust in time and effectively its monetary policy, in 1999 the 
Bank of Russia uses, in addition to its intermediate target, a wide 
range of indicators, such as nominal and real interest rates, 
nominal and real exchange rate dynamics, the dynamics of the world 
prices of Russian exports and imports, and yield curves of various 
financial instruments. The dollarisation of the Russian economy, 
which especially increased in 1998, makes it particularly important 
to use (M2X) broad money as indicator.
One of the monetary policy priorities in 1999 is to ensure 
economically sound dynamics of the exchange rate of the ruble. A 
floating exchange rate regime is in place now, but the Bank of 
Russia’s presence in the foreign exchange market is strictly limited 
and aims to cushion sharp rate fluctuations and protect the ruble 
from possible massive speculative attacks. The main condition of 
stability of the ruble rate dynamics is a balanced monetary policy 
ensuring compliance with the established money supply growth 
targets.
The exchange rate policy of the Bank of Russia is designed to 
regulate interest rates on its own operations in order to maintain 
the required level of liquidity of the banking system.
The chief means of providing additional liquidity to the banking 
system in 1999 is refinancing of commercial banks by granting them 
collateralised credits (intraday and overnight credits) and 
stabilisation credits for a term of up to 1 year within the limits 
of the monetary policy targets. As the situation in the banking 
sector returns to normal, the Bank of Russia will consistently 
reduce the proportion of stabilisation credits in the total 
refinancing volume, simultaneously expanding and improving the 
practice of extending collateralised credits and upgrading the 
instruments to fine-tune liquidity of the banking system.
Regarding deposit operations as a major means of regulating 
liquidity, the Bank of Russia on February 24 extended the term of 
deposit transactions with resident banks to 30 days.
The Bank of Russia is currently working on a set of measures to use 
the operations to rediscount promissory notes and other obligations 
issued by enterprises in the real economy.
