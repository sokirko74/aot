   Banking legislation is a part of overall Russian
   legislation. It is a system of enactments which regulate
   banking procedures. As Article 2 of the Federal Law on
   Banks and Banking Activities stipulates, banking is
   legally regulated by the Constitution of the Russian
   Federation, Federal Laws on the Central Bank of the
   Russian Federation (Bank of Russia), Federal Law on Banks
   and Banking Activities and other federal laws and Bank of
   Russia regulatory rules.

   The Constitution of the Russian Federation establishes the
   Bank of Russia’s independence (paragraph 2, Article 75).
   In addition, the Constitution of the Russian Federation
   (paragraph g, Article 71) stipulates that financial,
   foreign exchange and credit regulation and the issue of
   money are the exclusive competence of the Russian
   Federation and, consequently, the constituent territories
   of the Russian Federation have no right to adopt any laws
   on banking. In accordance with the Constitution of the
   Russian Federation, the rouble is the only legal tender of
   the Russian Federation and the Central Bank of the Russian
   Federation has the exclusive right to issue money. No
   other money can be issued or put into circulation in the
   Russian Federation (paragraph 1, Article 75).

   The Federal Law on the Central Bank of the Russian
   Federation (Bank of Russia) establishes the legal status
   of the Bank of Russia, the principles of its organisation
   and its main tasks and functions, the principles of its
   relations with the bodies of state power, the system of
   the executive bodies of the Bank of Russia’s and their
   competence, the Bank of Russia’s reporting and accounting
   procedures, the principles of organising cash circulation,
   the principles of implementing monetary policy and its
   major instruments, the range of Bank of Russia operations,
   the main principles and methods of banking regulation and
   supervision, the principles of organising non-cash
   settlements, the procedure for enforcing Bank of Russia
   regulatory rules, the status, rights and duties of Bank
   employees, etc.

   The Federal Law on Banks and Banking Activities defines
   credit organisations, banks and non-bank credit
   organisations and the banking system of the Russian
   Federation. It also establishes the range of banking
   operations that must be licensed and those which do not
   need to be licensed, the special conditions of credit
   organisations' activities in the securities market, the
   principles of relations between credit organisations and
   their clients and the state, the procedure for setting up
   credit organisations and registering and licensing them
   (including the procedure and special conditions for
   founding, registering and licensing credit organisations
   with a foreign stake), the grounds for revoking banking
   licences, the procedure for a credit organisation to open
   branches and representative offices, the principles of
   ensuring the financial stability of credit organisations,
   banking secrecy regulations, the grounds and procedure for
   arresting and incurring penalties on funds and other
   valuables kept in a credit organisation, anti-monopoly
   rules, a number of special conditions for conducting
   banking operations, the principles of organising savings
   business and the organisation of accounting and reporting
   by a credit organisation.

   The Bank of Russia actively participates in developing
   banking legislation. Lately it has issued regulatory rules
   on the procedure for registering and licensing credit
   organisations which set a number of mandatory standards
   for them and envisages penalties (including revoking of
   licences) against the credit organisations which violate
   banking legislation, and established rules for the credit
   organisations operating in the securities market and
   issuing their own securities, the procedure for effecting
   non-cash settlements and regulations on the use of the
   main instruments of monetary policy, such as compulsory
   reserves, Bank of Russia credits, etc.
