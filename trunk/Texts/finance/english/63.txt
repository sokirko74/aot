 The prevailing trend in the development of the Russian
 banking system in 1997 was the continued consolidation of
 capital and assets of credit institutions.

 In 1997 the aggregate capital of Russian banks grew by
 26.5% and as of January 1, 1998, amounted to 112.3 trillion
 roubles. The growth in own funds (capital) of the Russian
 banking system resulted, to a great extent, from the
 reduction in the number of credit institutions with
 negative capital.

 Last year saw the continuing process of concentration of
 banking assets in Russia's largest banks. The share of 200
 largest banks in the aggregate assets of the Russian
 banking system in 1997 rose by 3.2 percentage points (from
 85.1% to 88.4%) against 3.8 percentage points in 1996 (from
 81.9% as of January 1, 1996, to 85.9% as of January 1,
 1997).

 As banking capital and assets consolidated and returns from
 banking operations on the markets declined, the number of
 credit institutions continued to decrease. The rate of
 decrease in the number of credit institutions accelerated
 from 11.6% in 1996 to 16.3% in 1997.

 After the Bank of Russia raised the minimum authorised
 capital requirement for newly-created credit organisations
 and toughened licensing requirements, the number of
 newly-created credit institutions sharply declined. Only 12
 new credit institutions were registered in 1997 (28 in
 1996), of which three are fully controlled by foreign
 capital.

 The assets of operating credit institutions in 1997 rose by
 6.9% in real terms. At the same time, 727 banks (42% of the
 total), mostly small ones with assets accounting for 10% of
 all banking assets, saw a depletion of their assets in
 1997.

 As nominal interest rates on loans kept falling throughout
 1997 (from 66.2% p.a. as of January 1, 1997, to 25.3% p.a.
 as of January 1, 1998, on 3-month commercial credits), bank
 credits to the non-financial sector of the economy grew by
 35% (24% in real terms), while aggregate assets rose by
 19%. The proportion of credits extended by banks to the
 non-financial sector in the overall amount of banking
 assets in 1997 went up by 4 percentage points (from 29.5%
 to 33.5%).

 As some banks made efforts to throw off the burden of bad
 debts, the proportion of overdue debts in credit
 investments dropped from 6.8% as of January 1, 1997, to
 4.7% as of January 1, 1998, while overdue interest on
 credits fell by 33%, from 17.7 trillion roubles as of
 January 1, 1997, to 11.9 trillion roubles as of January 1,
 1998. The proportion of standard and non-standard loans in
 the total debt outstanding increased over 1997 from 92.9%
 to 96.2%.

 The share of aggregate commercial bank investments in
 securities in total banking assets expanded from 28.6% as
 of January 1, 1997, to 32.8% as of October 1, 1997, and
 fell to 31% as of January 1, 1998 (without Sberbank -
 20.1%, 24.9% and 23.7% respectively). The high level of
 bank investments in all kinds of securities posed a
 systemic risk at the end of last year when the world
 financial market was hit by crisis.

 Bank investments in interbank credit market operations in
 1997 decreased by 6.8%, from 57.3 trillion roubles as of
 January 1, 1997, to 53.5 trillion roubles as of January 1,
 1998. This decline in interbank credit operations on the
 domestic market led to a drop in their share of aggregate
 banking assets from 8.9% as of January 1, 1997, to 7% as of
 January 1, 1998.

 The proportion of funds attracted from the non-governmental
 sector of the economy continued to expand in the structure
 of bank liabilities (without Sberbank). Over the year these
 funds grew by 37.2% and their share of bank liabilities
 increased from 57.8% to 65.2%. Enterprises and
 organisations accounted for the lion’s share of the
 resources attracted by the banking system from the
 non-governmental sector of the economy and the proportion
 of these enterprises and organisations in liabilities
 increased from 26.8% as of January 1, 1997, to 30.8% as of
 January 1, 1998.

 Household savings (in roubles) in Russian commercial banks,
 excluding Sberbank, showed a 9.8% growth in the first half
 of 1997 but later declined, and at the end of the year
 remained unchanged from the beginning of the year.

 The expansion of overseas operations by Russian commercial
 banks increased the role of interbank credits as a major
 source of loans for credit institutions. Overall, the
 proportion of interbank credits in bank liabilities in 1997
 rose from 10.8% as of January 1, 1997, to 14.1% as of
 January 1, 1998. In nominal terms interbank credit volumes
 grew by 54% to 107.9 trillion roubles as of the end of
 1997.

 As of January 1, 1998, tradeable debt instruments accounted
 for 6.4% of total liabilities against 5.9% at the beginning
 of the year. Over the year investment in debt instruments
 went up by 28%. The volume of banks’ own rouble-denominated
 promissory notes and acceptances exceeded the volume of
 these instruments denominated in foreign currency 1.8 times
 as of January 1, 1998 (the former rose by 10% over the year
 and the latter by 100%).

 The financial position of banks in 1997 was characterised
 by a growing proportion of financially stable banks (banks
 showing no signs of financial troubles and banks with few
 shortcomings in their work) and a declining share of
 financially-troubled banks (banks with serious financial
 problems and banks in critical financial condition) in the
 total number of operating credit organisations. As of
 January 1, 1998, 66% of banks were rated as financially
 stable, of which 39% of banks had no signs of financial
 troubles and 27% had some shortcomings in their work (as of
 January 1, 1997, 54.3%, 42% and 12.3% respectively). As of
 January 1, 1998, financially stable banks accounted for
 84.7% of all banking assets. Problem banks accounted for
 32.4% of all operating credit institutions as of January 1,
 1998, and those in critical financial condition accounted
 for 22.7% of all operating banks. However, assets of this
 group of banks made up a lowly 2.9% of all banking assets
 as of January 1, 1998.
