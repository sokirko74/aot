Gazprom plans to eliminate restrictions on trading of its shares on the external 
market if the 9% limitation of foreign investor’s participation in the charter 
capital of the company is abolished. However, according to the CEO of Gazprom 
Rem Vyakhirev, this “will not happen today or tomorrow”.  

A group of Western banks headed by Deutsche Bank AG will offer Gazprom a 
syndicated loan in the amount of $230 mln. This is the largest syndicated loan 
ever received by a Russian company. The funds will be used to finance capital 
investment projects and technological development of the Russian gas industry.  

According to Veniamin Sokolov, an auditor with the Russia’s Accounting Chamber, 
the Chamber will do everything in its powers not to allow privatisation of 
Rosneft. Sokolov said that privatisation of Rosneft should be conducted on the 
basis of the privatisation program for 1998 that is still not approved and 
scheduled for review by the State Duma in mid-May 1998. In addition to that, the 
Accounting Chamber requested all documentation on valuation of stakes in 
Rosneft.
