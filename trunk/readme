This is a RML package (RML is Russian acronym, stands for Linguistic Environment).

This program is distributed under the Library GNU Public Licence, which is in the file
COPYING.  

This program was  written by Alexey Sokirko, Igor Nozhov, Lev Gershenzon, Andrey Putrin 
and many other people.

The project started in Moscow in Dialing 
Company (Russian and English language). The German part was created  
at Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in  Berlin (the project DWDS). 

Russian website (Russian documents) is www.aot.ru.

1. First you should register  RML variable, for example
  export  RML=/home/sokirko/RML

2. The project uses a regular expression library "PCRE" (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions).
We test compilation only with version 6.4. Other versions were not tested. 
One should download this version  from the official site and install it 
to the default place. If you do not want to install it or you do not have enough
rights to do it, then you should  create two environment variables: 
	1.  RML_PCRE_LIB, that  points to PCRE library directory, where
libpcre.a and libpcrecpp.a should be located, for example:
	export RML_PCRE_LIB=~/RML/contrib/pcre-6.4/.libs
	
	(libpcrecpp.a is only built when g++ is present, so make sure 
	you install g++ before you build pcre.)
	
    2  RML_PCRE_INCLUDE, that points to PCRE include catalog, 
where "pcrecpp.h" is located, for example
    export RML_PCRE_INCLUDE=~/RML/contrib/pcre-6.4
Varianbles  RML_PCRE_INCLUDE and RML_PCRE_LIB are needed only for compilation.

3. Then you should type
   sh build.sh

The script  builds the whole system. 

Run "build.sh --VS" if don't need to run make,
for example, you've built Sources in Visual Sudio and run build.sh in MSYS or Cygwin
to build dictionaries under Windows.
Make sure you have correct path to FlexLexer.h in Source/SimpleGrammarLib/MyFlexLexer.h 
if you build sources under Windows.
