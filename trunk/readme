====================== Introduction ====================

This is a RML package (RML is Russian acronym, stands for Linguistic Environment).

This program is distributed under the Library GNU Public Licence, which is in the file
COPYING.  

This program was  written by Alexey Sokirko, Igor Nozhov, Lev Gershenzon, Andrey Putrin 
and many other people.

The project started in Moscow in Dialing 
Company (Russian and English language). The German part was created  
at Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in  Berlin (the project DWDS). 

Russian website (Russian documents) is www.aot.ru.
More detail about Morphology dicts is here: Docs/Morph_UNIX.txt

==============  Prerequisites    ========================
0.   Install cmake (at least 3.5) from https://cmake.org/download/

1.  g++ 8.0 or higher or 

2. You need flex and bison to build projects after Morphology (Synan and Seman)
    For windows I used flex and bison from https://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison/?source=typ_redirect

3. To build lemmatizer_python(switched off by default) you need swig and python-dev,
    for windows I used 
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/files/swigwin/swigwin-3.0.12/swigwin-3.0.12.zip/download
    https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/

5. You need locale CP1251 and ISO-8859-1 under unix. 
On POSIX systems you can type "locale -a" to list the names of supported locales. 

ubuntu:
sudo locale-gen ru_RU.UTF-8
sudo locale-gen ru_RU.iso88595
sudo locale-gen de_DE
dpkg-reconfigure locales

See https://askubuntu.com/questions/76013/how-do-i-add-locale-to-ubuntu-server


=================   Compilation =======================

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
   // or with debug
